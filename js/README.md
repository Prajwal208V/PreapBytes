### How JavaScript engine executes a script
when JavaScript engine executes a script, it creates execution contexts. Each execution context has two phases: the creation phase and the execution phase.

creation phase:-
When a script executes for the first time, the JavaScript engine creates a Global Execution Context. During this creation phase it performs the following 
1.Create a global object i.e., window in the web browser or global in Node.js.
2.creates special variable called this  which points to the global object.
3.Setup a memory heap for storing variables and function references.
4.Store the function declarations in the memory heap and variables within the global execution context with the 
initial values as undefined.

The execution phase:-
During the execution phase, the JavaScript engine executes the code line by line. In this phase, it assigns values to variables and executes the function calls.
For every function call, the JavaScript engine creates a new Function Execution Context. The Function Execution Context is similar to the Global Execution Context, but instead of creating the global object, it creates the arguments object that contains a reference to all the parameters passed into the function.
To keep track of all the execution contexts, including the Global Execution Context and Function Execution Contexts,
the JavaScript engine uses a data structure named call stack.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### call stack
JavaScript engine uses a call stack to manage execution contexts: the Global Execution Context and Function Execution Contexts. The call stack works based on the LIFO principle i.e., last-in-first-out.

When we execute a script, the JavaScript engine creates a Global Execution Context and pushes it on top of the call stack.Whenever a function is called, the JavaScript engine creates a Function Execution Context for the function, pushes it on top of the Call Stack, and starts executing the function. If a function calls another function, the JavaScript engine creates a new Function Execution Context for the new function that is being called and pushes it on top of the call stack. When the current function completes, the JavaScript engine pops it from the call stack and resumes the execution where it left off in the last code listing. The script will stop when the call stack is empty.

### event Loop
JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language. measns, JavaScript can do only one thing at a single point in time.but When we call the setTimeout() function, make a fetch request or click a button, the web browser can do these activities concurrently and asynchronously. The setTimeout(), fetch requests, and DOM events are parts of the Web APIs of the web browser.
so browesr has js-engine,threadpool,callbackqueue,eventloop,microtask,Browser API 
javaScript engine place the setTimeout() return, fetch requests return, and DOM events into a callback queue.
The event loop is a constantly running process that monitors both the callback queue and the call stack.If the call stack is not empty, the event loop waits until it is empty and places the next function from the callback queue to the call stack. If the callback queue is empty.

### callbackqueue
javaScript maintains a queue of callback functions. It is called a callback queue or task queue. A queue data structure is First-In-First-Out(FIFO). So, the callback function that first gets into the queue has the opportunity to go out first. Callback Queue gets the ordinary callback functions coming from the setTimeout() API after the timer expires. Callback Queue has lesser priority than Microtask Queue of fetching the callback functions to Event Loop.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### microtask 
Microtask Queue is like the Callback Queue, but Microtask Queue has higher priority. All the callback functions coming through Promises. Promise handling always has higher priority so the JavaScript engine executes all the tasks from Microtask Queue and then moves to the Callback Queue. Microtask Queue has higher priority than Callback Queue of fetching the callback functions to Event Loop.

### data types in js
Data types basically specify what kind of data can be stored and manipulated within a program.
There are 7 Primitive data types and Object, Array, and Function (which are all types of objects) are composite data types in JavaScript

1.The Boolean data type :- can hold only two values: true or false.
JavaScript, there are only five falsy values-> zero, the empty string, undefined, null,NAN

2.Undefined :- (is a primitive type in JavaScript.)type The undefined data type can only have one value-the special value undefined. If a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned a value, has the value undefined.undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The initial value of undefined is the primitive value A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined.
(A variable or an object has an undefined value when no value is assigned before using it.)
JavaScript uses the undefined value in the following situations.
1) Accessing an uninitialized variable
2) Accessing a non-existing property of an object
3) Function parameters :- call the a function and don’t pass all the arguments, the parameters inside the function becomes undefined
4) Functions return a value :- A function that doesn’t have a return statement implicitly returns undefined
5) Accessing out-of-bounds array elements 

3.null type:- You can assign null to a variable to denote that currently that variable does not have any value but it will have later on. A null means absence of a value.(JavaScript uses the null value to represent the intentional absence of any object value.),typeof null is object

4.NAN :- stands for 'Not a Number' It represents a value which is not a valid number.NaN is a property of the global object. 
NaN, It is a result of an invalid or an undefined mathematical operation.
Operations return NaN
1) Parsing numbers :- If JavaScript cannot convert a string to a number, it returns NaN. In this case, NaN indicates that the parsing has failed.
   ex:- parseInt('x100')
2) Use undefined as an operand :- console.log(undefined * 2); // NaN
3) Using NaN as an operand :- console.log( 10 + 1 / NaN ); // NaN
4) Using indeterminate forms :- When an arithmetical operation is in the indeterminate form, it returns NaN ex:- console.log(10 + 0 / 0); // NaN
5) Using invalid arguments of math functions :- When a math function receives an invalid argument, it returns NaN 
   ex:- console.log( Math.sqrt(-1));// NaN  Since it only accepts a non-negative number, passing -1 results in NaN.

5.number type :- Js The number data type is used to represent positive or negative  or decimal place, the JavaScript number type uses the IEEE-754 format.
ES2020 introduced a new primitive type bigint that represent big integer numbers whose values are larger than 2^53 – 1.

6.string type :- String type is used to represent textual data. It is a set of "elements" of 16-bit unsigned integer values,Each element in the String occupies a position in the String. The first element is at index 0, the next at index 1, and so on. The length of a String is the number of elements in it.
Strings are created using single or double quotes.JavaScript strings are immutable. This means that once a string is created, it is not possible to modify it.
   
7.Symbol type.

### Hoisting
When the JavaScript engine executes the JavaScript code, it creates the global execution context. The global execution context has two phases: creation and execution.During the creation phase, the JavaScript engine moves the variable and function declarations to the top of your code. This feature is known as hoisting in JavaScript. so we can use functions and variables before they're declared.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### TDZ temporal dead zone
there is a period between entering scope and being declared where they cannot be accessed. This period is the temporal dead zone (TDZ). Accessing let and const varibles  in the inner scope still causes a ReferenceError. If let were not hoisted, it would log outer value. The TDZ is a good thing because it helps to highlight bugs—accessing a value before it has been declared is rarely intentional.
The TDZ also applies to default function arguments. Arguments are evaluated left to right, and each argument is in the TDZ until it is assigned
            function testDefaults(a = b, b) { }
            testDefaults(undefined, 1);

### let const var
using these three we can declare a variable in JavaScript,
VAR:
Before the ES6, var was var only way to declare variables. and let and var after ES 2015.
->Scope of var: When we declare a variable outside a function its scope is global.the variables whose declaration happens with "var" outside a function (even within a block) are accessible in the whole window. but when the declaration of a variable occurs inside a function, it is available and accessible only within that function. that's why var is function scope.
->Re-declaration of "var" variables:The variables declared using var can be re-declared within the same scope also, and it will not raise any error.
->Hoisting of var:So var variables hoist to the top of its scope and initialize with a value of undefined.

LET:In ES 2015 release, ES released one more keyword for declaration of variables, which is known as the "let".
->Scope of let:let is block scoped. A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. Moreover, a variable that one declares in a block with the "let" is only available for use within that block only."let" are block-scoped and can't access outside the block in which the declaration happens.
->Re-declaration of "let" variables:The variable declared using let can't be re-declared.
->Hoisting of let: let declarations hoist to the top. But, unlike var, which initializes as undefined, the let keyword does not initialize. So if you try to use a let variable before the declaration, you'll get a "Reference Error".

CONST: Variables declared with the "const" keyword maintain constant values and can't change their values during the scope. 
Scope of const:Similar to let, the scope of the const variables is also blocked.
Re-declaration of const variables:Similar to let variables, the variable declared using const can't be re-declared.
Hoisting of const:Just like "let", "const" declarations hoist to the top but don't initialize.

### Strict equality 
==(equality operator or loose equality operator) and the other one is === (strict equality operator). Both of these operators check the value of operands for equality. But, the difference between == & === is that the == does a type conversion before checking for equality.

### JavaScript is a loosely typed and dynamic language
means we don’t have to explicitly specify types of variables and objects. but in A strongly typed language we should specified what kind of data/value we are storing it but TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript it is strongly typed language.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### difference between type conversion and type coercion
type coercion:- is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another,the coercion is done implicitly. When JavaScript operates in a wrong data type, it will try to convert the value to the right data type.
examples:- 
12 + ""    //Output is "12" as number 12 is converted to string "12"
"15" * 2    //Output is 30 as string 15 is converted to number 15
undefined + 6 //Output is NaN as undefined could not be converted to number
"Hello" + null  //Output is "Hellonull", as null is converted to string "null"
null + 25     //Output is 25, as null is converted to 0.
true + true //Output is 2, as true is converted to number 1.
false + 10 //Output is 10, as false is converted to number 0.
10 * [6] //Output is 60, as [6] is converted to number 6.
10 * [10, 20] //Output is NaN, as [10, 20] could not be converted to number
[1] + [1,2] //Output is "11,2" as [1] is converted to "1" and [1,2] is converted "1,2". Finally the two are concatenated to give the result "11,2"
           
Type conversion:- (In this case, type conversion is explicitly done in the code by the developer.) JavaScript provides inbuilt methods for type conversion. using the inbuilt functions like Number(), String(), Boolean(),paresInt() etc.
examples:-1)Converting to Number:- The Number() global method is used to convert any other data type value to numeric values.
Number("25") //Output is 25 as "25" string is converted to number 25
Number("") //Output is 0 as "" string is converted to 0
Number([]) //Output is 0 as [] is converted to 0
Number(null) //Output is 0 as null is converted to 0
Number(true) //Output is 1 as true is converted to 1
Number(false) //Output is 0 as false is converted to 0
Number("Test") //Output is NaN as "Test" could not be converted to number
parseInt() and parseFloat() methods can also be used to convert numbers stored as a string to a number. 
For all other data types, it will return NaN.

2)Converting to String :-The String() global method is used to convert any other data type value to string values.
String(25) //Output is "25" as 25 is converted to string "25"
String([]) //Output is "" as [] is converted to empty string ""
String(null) //Output is "null" as null is converted to string "null"
String(true) //Output is "true" as true is converted to string "true"
String(false) //Output is "false" as false is converted to string "false"
String({}) //Output is "[object Object]" as {} is converted to string(similar to calling toString() on a object)

3)Converting to Boolean:- The Boolean() global method is used to convert any other data type value to Boolean values.
Boolean(25) //Output is true
Boolean([]) //Output is true
Boolean(null) //Output is false
Boolean({}) //Output is true
Boolean("Yeah! I will be converted to Boolean.") //Output is true

### pass by value and pass by reference 
passed by value:-
In JavaScript, all function arguments are always passed by value. It means that JavaScript copies the values of the variables into the function arguments.
Any changes that you make to the arguments inside the function do not reflect the passing variables outside of the function. In other words, the changes made to the arguments are not reflected outside of the function.

passed by reference  value:-
If function arguments are passed by reference, the changes of variables that you pass into the function will be reflected outside the function.This is not possible in JavaScript. passing paramaters as objects

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### deep and shallow copies
shallow copies:-
When a reference variable is copied into a new reference variable using the assignment operator, a shallow copy of the referenced object is created. In simple words, a reference variable mainly stores the address of the object it refers to. When a new reference variable is assigned the value of the old reference variable, the address stored in the old reference variable is copied into the new one. This means both the old and new reference variable point to the same object in memory. As a result if the state of the object changes through any of the reference variables it is reflected for both. 
ex:- 
var employee = {
    eid: "E102",
    ename: "Jack",
    eaddress: "New York",
    salary: 50000
}
var newEmployee = employee;    // Shallow copy

deep copies:-
deep copy makes a copy of all the members of the old object, allocates separate memory location for the new object and then assigns the copied members to the new object. In this way, both the objects are independent of each other and in case of any modification to either one the other is not affected. Also, if one of the objects is deleted the other still remains in the memory. Now to create a deep copy of an object in JavaScript we use JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() methods. 
ex:-
var employee = {
    eid: "E102",
    ename: "Jack",
    eaddress: "New York",
    salary: 50000
}
var newEmployee = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(employee)); //Deep Copy

Here the new object is created using the JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() methods of JavaScript. JSON.stringify() takes a JavaScript object as argument and then transforms it into a JSON string. This JSON string is passed to the JSON.parse() method which then transforms it into a JavaScript object. This method is useful when the object is small and has serializable properties. But if the object is very large and contains certain non-serializable properties then there is a risk of data loss. Specially if an object contains methods then JSON.stringify() will fail as methods are non-serializable. There are better ways to deep clone of which one is Lodash which allows cloning methods as well.

Lodash To Deep Copy:(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-shallow-copy-and-deep-copy-in-javascript/)
Lodash is a JavaScript library that provides multiple utility functions and one of the most commonly used function of the Lodash library is the cloneDeep() method. This method helps in deep cloning of an object and also clones the non serializable properties which were a limitation in the JSON.stringify() approach.
ex:-
const lodash = require('lodash');
   var employee = {
       eid: "E102",
       ename: "Jack",
       eaddress: "New York",
       salary: 50000,
       details: function () {
           return "Employee Name: "
               + this.ename + "-->Salary: "
               + this.salary;
       }
   }
   var deepCopy = lodash.cloneDeep(employee);

### Function 
is a A block of code which we can use multiple times, so you define or declare it once, and then  use it wherever we want as many times.
different ways of declaring a function in JS
1)Function Expression:-   var greet = function () { }
2)Anonymous Function:-  
3)Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)
4)Constructor Function
5)Arrow Function
6)regular function
7)Generator function 

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### IIFE
Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) are functions that can be stated as expressions or normal declarations and use the anonymous property of the function expression to execute its code. If you want to execute a function immediately after the declaration, use IIFE. This is executed by wrapping the anonymous function in parentheses and ending it with a semicolon.
       (function () {
            console.log("Welcome to Javascript");
        })();

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Anonymous Function 
Anonymous function declaration allows function names to appear hidden in the declaration itself. An anonymous function can also be an argument of a function hence, it can be declared inside another function as its parameters.
   setTimeout(
        function () {
          console.log("Executed after three seconds");
        }  , 3000 // delay in milliseconds
    )

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Higher Order Functions
A higher order function is a function that takes a function as an argument, or returns a function.we are using higher-order functions when passing callback functions.some pre-defined methods are map,filter,settimout,Eventlistener these methods take a function as an argument.
ex:-  const firstOrderFunc = () => console.log ('Hello, I am a First order function');
      const higherOrder = ReturnFirstOrderFunc => ReturnFirstOrderFunc();
      higherOrder(firstOrderFunc);

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### callback functions
A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument. This function is invoked inside the outer function to complete an action.
this callback function uesd in many inbuild methods: like,filter,map,addEventListener

### What is a pure function
Pure Function is a function (a block of code ) that always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed. It does not depend on any state, or data change during a program’s execution rather it only depends on its input arguments. Also a pure function does not produce any observable side effects such as network requests or data mutation etc.
ex:-    function calculateGST( productPrice ) {
               return productPrice * 0.05;
         }

### What are lambda or arrow functions
arrow function arrow functions do not get their own 'this keyword' (lexical this keyword,) because it simply gets picked up from the outer lexical scope of the arrow function. basically an arrow function inherits the this keyword from the parent scope.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is a first class function
In Javascript, functions are first class objects. First-class functions means when functions in that language are treated like any other variable.
For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.
ex:-    const handler = () => console.log ('This is a click handler function');
         document.addEventListener ('click', handler);

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is a first order function
First-order function is a function that doesn’t accept another function as an argument and doesn’t return a function as its return value.
ex:- const firstOrder = () => console.log ('I am a first order function!');

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Unary function
Unary function (i.e. monadic) is a function that accepts exactly one argument. It stands for a single argument accepted by a function.
const unaryFunction = a => console.log (a + 10); // Add 10 to the given argument and display the value

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Generator function
https://www.javascripttutorial.net/es6/javascript-generators/ 
In JavaScript, a regular function is executed based on the run-to-completion model. It cannot pause midway and then continues from where it paused. ES6 introduces a new kind of function that is different from a regular function: function generator or generator.
A generator can pause midway and then continues from where it paused.
First, you see the asterisk (*) after the function keyword. The asterisk denotes that the generate() is a generator, not a normal function.
Second, the yield statement returns a value and pauses the execution of the function
      ex: function* generate() {
                console.log('invoked 1st time');
                yield 1;
                console.log('invoked 2nd time');
                yield 2;
           }

### recurstion
recurstion is a method of solving problems by breaking them  into smaller subsets of the main problem, so we can use this samll subset to find solustion.in programming we can achive this by calling a function itself, usually with a different input passed to the child function. It calls itself over and over until an exit condition is reached, and then passes the results back up the call stack.

if we doing with recurstion in programming we should keep two things in mind
   1.base condition 
   2.what is the return type
         
there are many different way to do recurstion
   1.tail recurstion- when a recursive call is the last thing
   2.Head Recursion- when a recursive call is the first thing
   3.Tree Recursion-
   4.Indirect Recursion-
   5.Nested Recursion-

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### this keyword
https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-this/
the this references the object of which the function is a property. In other words, the this references the object that is currently calling the function.
Which object depends on how this is being invoked (used or called).

The this keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used:
In an object method, this refers to the object.
Alone, this refers to the global object.
In a function, this refers to the global object.
In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.

ex:- Suppose you have an object called counter that has a method next(). When you call the next() method, you can access the this object.
let counter = {
   count: 0,
   next: function () {
    return ++this.count;
   },
};
counter.next();
Inside the next() function, the this references the counter object. See the following method call:
The next() is a function that is the property of the counter object. Therefore, inside the next() function, the this references the counter object.


but In the global context, the this references the global object, which is the window object on the web browser or global object on Node.js.
but in arrow functions do not get their own 'this keyword' (lexical this keyword,) because it simply gets picked up from the outer lexical scope of the arrow function.
basically an arrow function inherits the this keyword from the parent scope.
console.log(`in global execution context 'this keyword' points to window object: `,this);
 var obj={
            firstName:"Prajwal",
            lastName:"Veeresh",
            method:function(){
                console.log(`in function execution context 'this keyword' points to parent object of method: `,this);
                console.log(`fullName: ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`);
            }
        }
        obj.method();
        
arrow function arrow functions do not get their own 'this keyword' (lexical this keyword,) because it simply gets picked up from the outer lexical scope of the arrow function. basically an arrow function inherits the this keyword from the parent scope.
        var obj2={
            from:"Bangalore",
            method:()=>{
                console.log(this);// O/P window object
            }
        }
        obj2.method();
        var obj3={
            to:'USA',
            inside_obj:{
                flightNo:145678,
                inside_method:()=>{
                    console.log(this);// O/P window object
                }
            }
        }
        obj3.inside_obj.inside_method();
        
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### call bind apply methods
call,bind,apply methods to tie a function into an object and call the function as if it belonged to that object The bind method creates a copy of the function and sets the this keyword
Call: The call() method invokes a function with a given this value and arguments provided one by one
Apply: Invokes the function with a given this value and allows you to pass in arguments as an array
bind: returns a new function, allowing you to pass any number of arguments

Call and apply are pretty interchangeable. Both execute the current function immediately. You need to decide whether it’s easier to send in an array or a comma separated list of arguments. You can remember by treating Call is for comma (separated list) and Apply is for Array.
Whereas Bind creates a new function that will have this set to the first parameter passed to bind().

var employee1 = {firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Rodson'};
var employee2 = {firstName: 'Jimmy', lastName: 'Baily'};
function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
    console.log(greeting1 + ' ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName+ ', '+ greeting2);
}

call
invite.call(employee1, 'Hello', 'How are you?'); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
invite.call(employee2, 'Hello', 'How are you?'); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?

apply
invite.apply(employee1, ['Hello', 'How are you?']); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
invite.apply(employee2, ['Hello', 'How are you?']); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
        
bind
var inviteEmployee1 = invite.bind(employee1);
var inviteEmployee2 = invite.bind(employee2);
inviteEmployee1('Hello', 'How are you?'); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
inviteEmployee2('Hello', 'How are you?'); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?

### scope
scope defines accessibility of variables, objects and functions in some particular part of programming code during runtime.
In other words, scope determines the visibility of variables and other resources in areas of your code.        

There are two types of scope in JavaScript.
1.Global scope: Variables declared outside of any function become global variables. so we can be access and modified from any function.
2.Local scope :
            a.Block Scope, it will apply only for let and const varibles but doesn't apply var varible
            b.Functional Scope, it will apply for let const and var
            
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
            
### scope chain
the JavaScript engine will try to find the variable’s value in the current scope.If it could not find the variable, it will look into the outer scope and will continue to do so until it finds the variable or reaches global scope.
If it’s still could not find the variable, it will either implicitly declare the variable in the global scope (if not in strict mode) or return an error.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### lexical scope
A lexical scope in JavaScript means that a variable defined outside a function can be accessible inside inside function defined after the variable declaration.
But the opposite is not true.
       var a = 10; 
          var par_func = function (){ // outermost function
            var b = 20;
            console.log("a and b is accessible (outer):", a, b);
            var innerFunc= function (){ // innermost function
              var c = 30;
              console.log("a and b and c is accessible (innner):", a, b, c);
            }
            innerFunc();
          }
          par_func()
        
        
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Closures
A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment which measn that function was declared.It is an inner function that has access to the outer or enclosing function’s variables. The closure has three scope chains.
The closure has three scope chains
 1.Own scope where variables defined between its curly brackets
 2.Outer function’s variables
 3.Global variables
        var a = 10; // variable a assigned to 10
        var par_func = function (){ // outermost function
          var b = 20;
          console.log("a and b is accessible (outer):", a, b);
          var innerFunc= function (){ // innermost function
            var c = 30;
            console.log("a and b and c is accessible (innner):", a, b, c);
           }
           return innerFunc;
        }
        var var25= par_func();
        var25();

### What are the possible ways to create objects in JavaScript
there are 5 ways to create object in js
1.Object Literal
2.using new Object() method 
3.using Object.create(proto,propertiesObject)
4.uinsg Constructor Function
5.using ES6 Classes

-Object Literal Way:
The Simplest and easiest way to create an object is using Object Literal “{}”. Just define properties and values inside curly braces
         let obj51={name:"Prajwal"};
         console.log(obj51.name);
        
-new Object() Way
way to create an Object is by using new Object() method. For simplicity, but readability and execution speed, by use object literal way.
         let obj52=new Object({name:"Prajwal"});
         console.log(obj52.name);

 Object Literal vs new Object()
{} is literal and literals are evaluated faster in JavaScript, but new Object() is a constructor call to function Object() which is having its own definition that takes comparatively more time to evaluate.

-Object.create(proto,propertiesObject) Way.this method creates a new object, using an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object.
it takes two parameters. The first parameter is a mandatory object that serves as the prototype of the new object to be created. The second parameter is an optional object which contains the properties to be added to the new object.
         let object53=Object.create(obj51,{new_property:{value:23}});

-Constructor Function Way
The constructor function is a function allows to create multiple objects of the same constructor function with the help of new keyword
Technically speaking, a constructor function is a regular function with the following convention:
* The name of a constructor function starts with a capital letter like Person, Document, etc.
* A constructor function should be called only with the new operator.
      function Constructor_fun(name,age,phone){
            this.name=name;
            this.age=age;
            this.phone=phone;
      }
      let obj54=new Constructor_fun("Prajwal");

-ES6 Classes
By using classes we can create a new objects.The constructor method is a special method of a class for creating and initializing an object instance of that class.
      class cls_Obj{
          constructor(name, age, phone){
            this.name=name;
            this.age=age;
            this.phone=phone;
          }
        }
        let obj55=new cls_Obj("Prajwal",23);

### Prototypes
Prototypes: are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another. Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property called prototype.The prototype is itself an object.
When we try to access a property of an object: if the property can't be found in the object itself, the prototype is searched for the property. If the property still can't be found, then the prototype's prototype is searched, and so on until either the property is found, or the end of the chain is reached, in which case undefined is returned.
      const obj8={
          city:"Bangalore",
          greet:function (){
            console.log(`Greetings from ${this.city}`);
          }
      }
      console.log(obj8)//list of all the properties available to this object.these extra properties come from prototype
to check its own property or not using hasOwnProperty() method 
console.log(obj8.hasOwnProperty('city'));//true
console.log(obj8.hasOwnProperty('name'));//false
->Object.prototype, is the most basic prototype, that all objects have by default. The prototype of Object.prototype is null, so it's at the end of the prototype chain:
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(obj8));//Object {...}
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.getPrototypeOf(obj8)));//null

### prototype chaining
When we try to access a property of an object: if the property can't be found in the object itself, the prototype is searched for the property. If the property still can't be found, then the prototype's prototype is searched, and so on until either the property is found, or the end of the chain is reached, in which case undefined is returned.
        let person_obj={
          name:"Veeresh",
          college:"B.M.S.C.E"
        }
        let person_obj2=Object.create(person_obj,{age:{value:"23"}});
        console.log(person_obj2.hasOwnProperty('age'));//true
        console.log(person_obj2.hasOwnProperty('name'));//false
        let person_obj3=Object.create(person_obj2,{number:{value:"9148302***"}});

### Object Destructuring
OavaScript Object Destructuring is the syntax for extracting values from an object property and assigning them to a variable.

            ```let person={
               name:"Prajwal V",
               age:23,
               from:"Bengaluru"
            }
            let name=person.name;
            let age=person.age;
            let from=person.from;
            ```
We have to explicitly mention the name and age property with the user object in dot(.) notation, then declare variables accordingly and assign them. 
Setting default values and also we assign the age property to the age variable with the default value of 18.
            ```let{name,age,from}=person;
            let{name,age:currentAge=18,from,contactNo='63628***',}=person;
            ```
if property not there in object it will take defult value

127. ### How do you test for an empty object

     There are different solutions based on ECMAScript versions
     1. **Using Object entries(ECMA 7+):** You can use object entries length along with constructor type.

     ```javascript
     Object.entries(obj).length === 0 && obj.constructor === Object // Since date object length is 0, you need to check constructor check as well
     ```

     1. **Using Object keys(ECMA 5+):** You can use object keys length along with constructor type.

     ```javascript
     Object.keys(obj).length === 0 && obj.constructor === Object // Since date object length is 0, you need to check constructor check as well
     ```

     1. **Using for-in with hasOwnProperty(Pre-ECMA 5):** You can use a for-in loop along with hasOwnProperty.

     ```javascript
     function isEmpty(obj) {
       for(var prop in obj) {
         if(obj.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
           return false;
         }
       }

       return JSON.stringify(obj) === JSON.stringify({});
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

125. ### How do you check if a key exists in an object

     You can check whether a key exists in an object or not using three approaches,

     1. **Using in operator:** You can use the in operator whether a key exists in an object or not

     ```javascript
     "key" in obj
     ```

     and If you want to check if a key doesn't exist, remember to use parenthesis,

     ```javascript
     !("key" in obj)
     ```

     1. **Using hasOwnProperty method:** You can use `hasOwnProperty` to particularly test for properties of the object instance (and not inherited properties)

     ```javascript
     obj.hasOwnProperty("key") // true
     ```

     1. **Using undefined comparison:** If you access a non-existing property from an object, the result is undefined. Let’s compare the properties against undefined to determine the existence of the property.

     ```javascript
     const user = {
       name: 'John'
     };

     console.log(user.name !== undefined);     // true
     console.log(user.nickName !== undefined); // false
     ```

### SET
A set is a collection of items which are unique i.e no element can be repeated, values of any type.Set in ES6 are ordered: elements of the set can be iterated in the insertion order. Set can store any types of values whether primitive or objects.
To create a new empty Set, 
            ```let setObject = new Set();
            ```
The Set constructor also accepts an optional iterable object. If you pass an iterable object to the Set constructor, all the elements of the iterable object will be added to the new set:
Set methods:
   1.add(value) – appends a new element with a specified value to the set.
2.clear()  – removes all elements from the Set object.
3.delete(value) – deletes an element specified by the value.
4.entries()– returns a new Iterator that contains an array of  [value, value]
5.forEach(callback [, thisArg]) – invokes a callback on each element of the Set with the this value sets to thisArg in each call.
6.has(value) – returns true if an element with a given value is in the set, or false if it is not.
7.keys() – is the same as values() function.

    ```let chars = new Set(['a', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'c']);
       console.log(chars);//Set { 'a', 'b', 'c' }
       console.log(chars.size);//  3
       console.log(chars instanceof Set);// true
       chars.add('d');// Set { 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' }
       console.log(chars.has('a'));// true
       chars.delete('d'); //   Set { 'a', 'b', 'c',}
       chars.clear(); //Set{}
  
       for (let char of chars) {
          console.log(char);
       }

       for (let [key, value] of chars.entries()) { //Set also provides the keys(), values(), and entries() methods like the Map.Set are identical. 
         console.log(key === value);
       }
       Invoke a callback function on each element of a set,If you want to invoke a callback on every element of a set, you can use the forEach() method.
       chars.forEach(char => console.log(char.toUpperCase()));
       ```

### MAP
A data structure in which data is stored as key value pairs. In which a unique key maps to a value. Both the key and the value can be in any data type.A map is an iterable data structure. This means that the sequence of insertion is remembered and that we can access the elements in e.g. a for..of loop.

-A Map is ordered and iterable, whereas a objects is not ordered and not iterable
-We can put any type of data as a Map key, whereas objects can only have a number, string, or symbol as a key.
-A Map inherits from Map.prototype. This offers all sorts of utility functions and properties which makes working with Map objects a lot easier.
```let map = new Map([iterable]);
```
methods:
1.clear() – removes all elements from the map object.
2.delete(key) – removes an element specified by the key. It returns if the element is in the map, or false if it does not.
3.entries() – returns a new Iterator object that contains an array of [key, value] for each element in the map object. The order of objects in the map is the same as the insertion order.
4.forEach(callback[, thisArg]) – invokes a callback for each key-value pair in the map in the insertion order. The optional thisArg parameter sets the this value for each callback.
5.get(key) – returns the value associated with the key. If the key does not exist, it returns undefined.
6.has(key) – returns true if a value associated with the key exists, otherwise, return false.
7.keys() – returns a new Iterator that contains the keys for elements in insertion order.
8.values() returns a new iterator object that contains values for each element in insertion order.
9.set(key, value) – sets the value for the key in the map object. It returns the map object itself therefore you can chain this method with other methods.

```let userRoles = new Map();
   console.log(userRoles instanceof Map); // true
   userRoles.set(john, 'admin');
   
   let userRoles = new Map([  //Initialize a map with an iterable object
    [john, 'admin'],
    [lily, 'editor'],
    [peter, 'subscriber']
   ]);
   
   userRoles.get(john); // admin
   userRoles.get({name: 'Foo'}); //undefined 
   userRoles.has(lily); // true
   console.log(userRoles.size); // 3
   
   //Iterate over map keys
   for (const user of userRoles.keys()) {
      console.log(user.name);
   }
   //Iterate over map values
   for (let role of userRoles.values()) {
      console.log(role);
   }
   //entries()
   for (const role of userRoles.entries()) {
      console.log(`${role[0].name}: ${role[1]}`);
   }
   //forEach() method of the map object:
   userRoles.forEach((role, user) => console.log(`${user.name}: ${role}`));
  ```

### weakSet
A WeakSet is similar to a Set except that it contains only objects.Just as with Sets, each object in a WeakSet may occur only once; all objects in a WeakSet's collection are unique.WeakSets are collections of objects only ,They cannot contain prmitive values like string,numbers,null,undfined If you try to add anything else than an object JavaScript will throw an error.
The WeakSet is weak,means {weakset objects loses all references it will be “marked”} for garbage collection.we know javascript has  garbage collection algorithm inside the JavaScript engine,which automatically removes old, unused objects from the computer memory. When this garbage collection happens this object is released from the memory. It is gone.we can’t predict when it will happen.WeakSets are not iterable.(No iteration and size property) in weakSet and wekMap objects
The main difference is that references to objects in Set are strong while references to objects in WeakSet are weak. i.e, An object in WeakSet can be garbage collected if there is no other reference to it.
1.Sets can store any value Whereas WeakSets can store only collections of objects
2.WeakSet does not have size property unlike Set
3.WeakSet does not have methods such as clear, keys, values, entries, forEach.
4.WeakSet is not iterable.

```var ws = new WeakSet();
   let my_weakSet=new WeakSet([obj2,obj3]);
   let obj={name:"prajwal",age:23}
   my_weakSet.add(obj);
   my_weakSet.delete(obj3);Removing objects from WeakSets using delete() method It will return true if the object was successfully removed. 
   console.log(my_weakSet.has(obj),my_weakSet.has(obj3));// Checking if object exists in a WeakSet
```

 **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### weakMap
The WeakMap object is a collection of key/value pairs in which the keys are weakly referenced. In this case, keys must be objects and the values can be arbitrary values. not with any other data type.all keys in a WeakMap are weakly referenced. This means that objects used as key for a WeakMap can still be garbage collected. This will happen when all references to those objects are gone.When these objects are no longer used by any part of the program,garbage collection will free them from memory.
The main difference is that references to key objects in Map are strong while references to key objects in WeakMap are weak. i.e, A key object in WeakMap can be garbage collected if there is no other reference to it. Other differences are,
1.Maps can store any key type Whereas WeakMaps can store only collections of key objects
2.WeakMap does not have size property unlike Map
3.WeakMap does not have methods such as clear, keys, values, entries, forEach.
4.WeakMap is not iterable.

```var ws = new WeakMap();
   ws.set(user);
   ws.has(user);    // true
   ws.delete(user); // removes user from the map
   ws.has(user);    // false, user has been removed
```

62. ### What is callback in callback

    You can nest one callback inside in another callback to execute the actions sequentially one by one. This is known as callbacks in callbacks.

    ```javascript
    loadScript('/script1.js', function(script) {
       console.log('first script is loaded');

      loadScript('/script2.js', function(script) {

        console.log('second script is loaded');

        loadScript('/script3.js', function(script) {

            console.log('third script is loaded');
          // after all scripts are loaded
        });

      })

    });
    ```

61. ### What are the main rules of promise

    A promise must follow a specific set of rules,
    1. A promise is an object that supplies a standard-compliant `.then()` method
    2. A pending promise may transition into either fulfilled or rejected state
    3. A fulfilled or rejected promise is settled and it must not transition into any other state.
    4. Once a promise is settled, the value must not change.

93. ### What are the pros and cons of promises over callbacks

    Below are the list of pros and cons of promises over callbacks,

    **Pros:**
    1. It avoids callback hell which is unreadable
    2. Easy to write sequential asynchronous code with .then()
    3. Easy to write parallel asynchronous code with Promise.all()
    4. Solves some of the common problems of callbacks(call the callback too late, too early, many times and swallow errors/exceptions)

    **Cons:**
    1. It makes little complex code
    2. You need to load a polyfill if ES6 is not supported

228. ### What are the different error names from error object

     There are 6 different types of error names returned from error object,
     | Error Name | Description |
     |---- | ---------
     | EvalError  | An error has occurred in the eval() function |
     | RangeError | An error has occurred with a number "out of range"  |
     | ReferenceError | An error due to an illegal reference|
     | SyntaxError | An error due to a syntax error|
     | TypeError | An error due to a type error |
     | URIError | An error due to encodeURI() |

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
     
### CALLBACK hell
we tries to execute multiple asynchronous operations one after the other. By nesting callbacks The use of callbacks makes the code difficult to write and maintain. It also increases the difficulty of identifying the flow of the application,
```async1(function(){
    async2(function(){
        async3(function(){
            async4(function(){
                ....
            });
        });
    });
});
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### promise
promise is an object  that may produce a single value some time in the future with either a resolved value or a reason that it’s not resolved(for example, network error). 
It will be in one of the 3 possible states: 
pending:initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
or rejected:meaning that the operation failed.
A pending promise can either be fulfilled with a value or rejected with a reason (error)

Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations. They provide an alternative approach for callbacks by reducing the callback hell and writing the cleaner code.
Creating a promise:create a promise in JavaScript, you use the Promise constructor:
   ```const promise = new Promise(resolve => {
        setTimeout(() => {
          resolve("I'm a Promise!");
        }, 5000);
     }, reject => {
   });
   promise.then(value => console.log(value));
   ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Consuming a Promise
by using then, catch, finally methods to further action with a promise that becomes settled.
         then():method is used to schedule a callback to be executed when the promise is successfully resolved.
         this method takes two callback functions:- promiseObject.then(onFulfilled, onRejected);
         catch():

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### promise chaining
The instance method of the Promise object such as then(), catch(), or finally() returns a separate "promise object".Therefore, you can call the promise’s instance method on the return Promise. The successively calling methods in this way is referred to as the promise chaining.
The process of executing a sequence of asynchronous tasks one after another using promises is known as Promise chaining.
```let my_promise3=new Promise((resolve, reject)=>{
          setTimeout(()=>{
             resolve(1);
          },1*1000)
       })
       my_promise3.then((result)=>{
         console.log(result);
         return result*2
       }).then((result)=>{
        console.log(result);
        return result*3
       }).then((result)=>{
        console.log(result);
       })
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### promise.all
Promise.all is a promise that takes an array of promises as an input (an iterable), and it gets resolved when all the promises get resolved or any one of them gets rejected.

```Promise.all([Promise1, Promise2, Promise3]) .then(result) => {   console.log(result) }) .catch(error => console.log(`Error in promises ${error}`)) ```
Note: Remember that the order of the promises(output the result) is maintained as per input order.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### promise.race
Promise.race() method will return the promise instance which is firstly resolved or rejected. example of race() method where promise2 is resolved first

```var promise1 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(resolve, 500, 'one');
   });
   var promise2 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(resolve, 100, 'two');
   });
   
   Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(function(value) {
      console.log(value); // "two" // Both promises will resolve, but promise2 is faster
   });
```

### try catch throw finally in js
When executing JavaScript code, errors will most definitely occur. These errors can occur due to the fault from the programmer’s side or the input is wrong or even if there is a problem with the logic of the program. When an error occurs, JavaScript will stop and generate an error message.
No one wants its software to fail or crash. Exceptions are the major reason for software failure. The exceptions can be handled in the program beforehand and prevent the execution from stopping. This is known as exception handling.exception handling is the mechanism for identifying the undesirable states that the program can reach and specifying the desirable outcomes of such states.Try-catch is the most common method used for handling exceptions in the program.
~The try statement lets you test a block of code to check for errors.
~The catch statement lets you handle the error if any are present.
~The throw statement lets you make your own errors.
~The finally statement lets you execute code, after try and catch.
~The finally block runs regardless of the result of the try-catch block.
```try {
  let result = add(10, 20);
  console.log(result);
} catch (e) {
  console.log({ name: e.name, message: e.message });
}
console.log('Bye');
```
```try {
      let result = add(10, 20);
      throw {name:'error',message:'please eneter valid i/p'}
   } catch (e) {
      console.log({ name: e.name, message: e.message });
   }
```

### What are the possible ways to create an array
An array in JavaScript can be defined and initialized in two ways, 1.array literal and 2.Array constructor way.
Array Literal syntax is simple. It takes a list of values separated by a comma and enclosed in square brackets. 
 ```let arr=["a","b","c","d","e","f"];```

Array Constructor initialize an array with Array constructor syntax using new keyword.
```var arrayName = new Array(element1, element2, element3,... elementN);
       let arr2=new Array();
```

### ways to empty the array 
4 Ways to Empty an Array in JavaScript
1.Assigning it to a new empty array
let arr=[];
2.set its length to zero
arr.length=0;
3.Using splice() method,splice method removing or replacing existing elements
arr.splice(0,arr.length)
4.Using pop() method:remove each element of the array one by one using the while loop and pop()
while(arr.length){
        arr.pop();
    }

### Destructuring array 
that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays we can extract data from arrays and objects and assign them to variables.
```const colorArr = ["red", "yellow", "blue", "green", "white", "black"];
   const [first, second] = colorArr;
   console.log(first, second);// red, yellow

111. ### What is JSON

     JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format that is used for data interchanging. It is based on a subset of JavaScript language in the way objects are built in JavaScript.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

112. ### What are the syntax rules of JSON

     Below are the list of syntax rules of JSON
     1. The data is in name/value pairs
     2. The data is separated by commas
     3. Curly braces hold objects
     4. Square brackets hold arrays

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

113. ### What is the purpose JSON stringify

     When sending data to a web server, the data has to be in a string format. You can achieve this by converting JSON object into a string using stringify() method.

     ```javascript
     var userJSON = {'name': 'John', age: 31}
     var userString = JSON.stringify(user);
     console.log(userString); //"{"name":"John","age":31}"
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

114. ### How do you parse JSON string

     When receiving the data from a web server, the data is always in a string format. But you can convert this string value to a javascript object using parse() method.

     ```javascript
     var userString = '{"name":"John","age":31}';
     var userJSON = JSON.parse(userString);
     console.log(userJSON);// {name: "John", age: 31}
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

115. ### Why do you need JSON

     When exchanging data between a browser and a server, the data can only be text. Since JSON is text only, it can easily be sent to and from a server, and used as a data format by any programming language.

66. ### What is a strict mode in javascript

    Strict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place a program, or a function, in a “strict” operating context. This way it prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions. The literal expression `"use strict";` instructs the browser to use the javascript code in the Strict mode.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

67. ### Why do you need strict mode

    Strict mode is useful to write "secure" JavaScript by notifying "bad syntax" into real errors. For example, it eliminates accidentally creating a global variable by throwing an error and also throws an error for assignment to a non-writable property, a getter-only property, a non-existing property, a non-existing variable, or a non-existing object.

68. ### How do you declare strict mode

    The strict mode is declared by adding "use strict"; to the beginning of a script or a function.
    If declared at the beginning of a script, it has global scope.

    ```javascript
    "use strict";
    x = 3.14; // This will cause an error because x is not declared
    ```

    and if you declare inside a function, it has local scope

    ```javascript
    x = 3.14;       // This will not cause an error.
    myFunction();

    function myFunction() {
      "use strict";
      y = 3.14;   // This will cause an error
    }
    ```

### rest parameter and spread operator
JavaScript uses three dots (...) for both the rest and spread operators.
~spread operator:allows you to spread out elements of an iterable object such as an array,a  map, or a set. means The spread operator unpacks elements.
~rest parameter:allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array (The rest parameter packs elements into an array.)
The main difference between rest and spread is that the rest operator puts the rest of some specific user-supplied values into a JavaScript array. But the spread syntax expands iterables into individual elements.
spread operator usecases
1.use case1 (array literal) when concat two or more arrys into a single array
```let arr1=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7];
   let arr2=[11,12,13,14,15,16,17];
   let arr3;
   arr3=[arr1,arr2]; //[Array(7), Array(7)]
   arr3=[...arr1,...arr2];//1,2,3,4,5,6,7,11,12,13,14,15,16,17
```

97. ### Is JavaScript a compiled or interpreted language

    JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. An interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs it. Nowadays  modern browsers use a technology known as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which compiles JavaScript to executable bytecode just as it is about to run.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

98. ### Is JavaScript a case-sensitive language

    Yes, JavaScript is a case sensitive language. The language keywords, variables, function & object names, and any other identifiers must always be typed with a consistent capitalization of letters.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

108. ### Why is JavaScript treated as Single threaded

     JavaScript is a single-threaded language. Because the language specification does not allow the programmer to write code so that the interpreter can run parts of it in parallel in multiple threads or processes. Whereas languages like java, go, C++ can make multi-threaded and multi-process programs.

398. ### What is babel

     Babel is a JavaScript transpiler to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Some of the main features are listed below,
     1. Transform syntax
     2. Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (using @babel/polyfill)
     3. Source code transformations (or codemods)

387. ### What are tasks in event loop

     A task is any javascript code/program which is scheduled to be run by the standard mechanisms such as initially starting to run a program, run an event callback, or an interval or timeout being fired. All these tasks are scheduled on a task queue.
     Below are the list of use cases to add tasks to the task queue,
     1. When a new javascript program is executed directly from console or running by the ```<script>``` element, the task will be added to the task queue.
     2. When an event fires, the event callback added to task queue
     3. When a setTimeout or setInterval is reached, the corresponding callback added to task queue

388. ### What is microtask

     Microtask is the javascript code which needs to be executed immediately after the currently executing task/microtask is completed. They are kind of blocking in nature. i.e, The main thread will be blocked until the microtask queue is empty.
     The main sources of microtasks are Promise.resolve, Promise.reject, MutationObservers, IntersectionObservers etc

     **Note:** All of these microtasks are processed in the same turn of the event loop.

393. ### What is heap

     Heap(Or memory heap) is the memory location where objects are stored when we define variables. i.e, This is the place where all the memory allocations and de-allocation take place. Both heap and call-stack are two containers of JS runtime.
     Whenever runtime comes across variables and function declarations in the code it stores them in the Heap.

394. ### What is an event table

     Event Table is a data structure that stores and keeps track of all the events which will be executed asynchronously like after some time interval or after the resolution of some API requests. i.e Whenever you call a setTimeout function or invoke async operation, it is added to the Event Table.
     It doesn't not execute functions on it’s own. The main purpose of the event table is to keep track of events and send them to the Event Queue as shown in the below diagram.

395. ### What is a microTask queue

     Microtask Queue is the new queue where all the tasks initiated by promise objects get processed before the callback queue.
     The microtasks queue are processed before the next rendering and painting jobs. But if these microtasks are running for a long time then it leads to visual degradation.

297. ### What is V8 JavaScript engine

     V8 is an open source high-performance JavaScript engine used by the Google Chrome browser, written in C++. It is also being used in the node.js project. It implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly, and runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors.
     **Note:** It can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.

148. ### How do you define JSON arrays

     JSON arrays are written inside square brackets and arrays contain javascript objects. For example, the JSON array of users would be as below,

     ```javascript
     "users":[
       {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Abrahm"},
       {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
       {"firstName":"Shane", "lastName":"Warn"}

296. ### What is jQuery

     jQuery is a popular cross-browser JavaScript library that provides Document Object Model (DOM) traversal, event handling, animations and AJAX interactions by minimizing the discrepancies across browsers. It is widely famous with its philosophy of “Write less, do more”. For example, you can display welcome message on the page load using jQuery as below,

     ```javascript
     $(document).ready(function(){ // It selects the document and apply the function on page load
         alert('Welcome to jQuery world');
     });
     ```

     **Note:** You can download it from jquery's official site or install it from CDNs, like google.

     function detectmob() {
      if( navigator.userAgent.match(/Android/i)
      || navigator.userAgent.match(/webOS/i)
      || navigator.userAgent.match(/iPhone/i)
      || navigator.userAgent.match(/iPad/i)
      || navigator.userAgent.match(/iPod/i)
      || navigator.userAgent.match(/BlackBerry/i)
      || navigator.userAgent.match(/Windows Phone/i)
      ){
         return true;
       }
      else {
         return false;
       }
     }
     ```

169. ### How do you make synchronous HTTP request

     Browsers provide an XMLHttpRequest object which can be used to make synchronous HTTP requests from JavaScript

     ```javascript
     function httpGet(theUrl)
     {
         var xmlHttpReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
         xmlHttpReq.open( "GET", theUrl, false ); // false for synchronous request
         xmlHttpReq.send( null );
         return xmlHttpReq.responseText;
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)** 

170. ### How do you make asynchronous HTTP request

     Browsers provide an XMLHttpRequest object which can be used to make asynchronous HTTP requests from JavaScript by passing the 3rd parameter as true.

     ```javascript
     function httpGetAsync(theUrl, callback)
     {
         var xmlHttpReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
         xmlHttpReq.onreadystatechange = function() {
             if (xmlHttpReq.readyState == 4 && xmlHttpReq.status == 200)
                 callback(xmlHttpReq.responseText);
         }
         xmlHttp.open("GET", theUrl, true); // true for asynchronous
         xmlHttp.send(null);
     }
     ```

210. ### How do you encode an URL

     The encodeURI() function is used to encode complete URI which has special characters except (, / ? : @ & = + $ #) characters.

     ```javascript
     var uri = 'https://mozilla.org/?x=шеллы';
     var encoded = encodeURI(uri);
     console.log(encoded); // https://mozilla.org/?x=%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BB%D1%8B
     ```

211. ### How do you decode an URL

     The decodeURI() function is used to decode a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) previously created by encodeURI().

     ```javascript
      var uri = 'https://mozilla.org/?x=шеллы';
      var encoded = encodeURI(uri);
      console.log(encoded); // https://mozilla.org/?x=%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BB%D1%8B
     try {
       console.log(decodeURI(encoded)); // "https://mozilla.org/?x=шеллы"
     } catch(e) { // catches a malformed URI
       console.error(e);
     }

287. ### How to get the value from get parameters

     The `new URL()` object accepts the url string and `searchParams` property of this object can be used to access the get parameters. Remember that you may need to use polyfill or `window.location` to access the URL in older browsers(including IE).

     ```javascript
     let urlString = "http://www.some-domain.com/about.html?x=1&y=2&z=3"; //window.location.href
     let url = new URL(urlString);
     let parameterZ = url.searchParams.get("z");

325. ### Is PostMessage secure

     Yes, postMessages can be considered very secure as long as the programmer/developer is careful about checking the origin and source of an arriving message. But if you try to send/receive a message without verifying its source will create cross-site scripting attacks.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

326. ### What are the problems with postmessage target origin as wildcard

     The second argument of postMessage method specifies which origin is allowed to receive the message. If you use the wildcard “*” as an argument then any origin is allowed to receive the message. In this case, there is no way for the sender window to know if the target window is at the target origin when sending the message. If the target window has been navigated to another origin, the other origin would receive the data. Hence, this may lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

     ```javascript
     targetWindow.postMessage(message, '*');
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

327. ### How do you avoid receiving postMessages from attackers

     Since the listener listens for any message, an attacker can trick the application by sending a message from the attacker’s origin,  which gives an impression that the receiver received the message from the actual sender’s window. You can avoid this issue by validating the origin of the message on the receiver's end using the “message.origin” attribute. For examples, let's check the sender's origin [http://www.some-sender.com](http://www.some-sender.com) on receiver side [www.some-receiver.com](www.some-receiver.com),

     ```javascript
     //Listener on http://www.some-receiver.com/
     window.addEventListener("message", function(message){
         if(/^http://www\.some-sender\.com$/.test(message.origin)){
              console.log('You received the data from valid sender', message.data);
        }
     });
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

328. ### Can I avoid using postMessages completely

     You cannot avoid using postMessages completely(or 100%). Even though your application doesn’t use postMessage considering the risks, a lot of third party scripts use postMessage to communicate with the third party service. So your application might be using postMessage without your knowledge.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

329. ### Is postMessages synchronous

     The postMessages are synchronous in IE8 browser but they are asynchronous in IE9 and all other modern browsers (i.e, IE9+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari).Due to this asynchronous behaviour, we use a callback mechanism when the postMessage is returned.

76. ### What is the difference between window and document

    Below are the main differences between window and document,

    | Window | Document |
    |---- | ---------
    | It is the root level element in any web page  | It is the direct child of the window object. This is also known as Document Object Model(DOM) |
    | By default window object is available implicitly in the page | You can access it via window.document or document.  |
    | It has methods like alert(), confirm() and properties like document, location | It provides methods like getElementById, getElementsByTagName, createElement etc  |

77. ### How do you access history in javascript

    The window.history object contains the browser's history. You can load previous and next URLs in the history using back() and next() methods.

    ```javascript
    function goBack() {
      window.history.back()
    }
    function goForward() {
      window.history.forward()
    }
    ```

    **Note:** You can also access history without window prefix.

90. ### What is the difference between document load and DOMContentLoaded events

    The `DOMContentLoaded` event is fired when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for assets(stylesheets, images, and subframes) to finish loading. Whereas The load event is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources(stylesheets, images).

91. ### What is the difference between native, host and user objects

    `Native objects` are objects that are part of the JavaScript language defined by the ECMAScript specification. For example, String, Math, RegExp, Object, Function etc core objects defined in the ECMAScript spec.
    `Host objects` are objects provided by the browser or runtime environment (Node). For example, window, XmlHttpRequest, DOM nodes etc are considered as host objects.
    `User objects` are objects defined in the javascript code. For example, User objects created for profile information.

172. ### What are the properties used to get size of window

     You can use innerWidth, innerHeight, clientWidth, clientHeight properties of windows, document element and document body objects to find the size of a window. Let's use them combination of these properties to calculate the size of a window or document,

     ```javascript
     var width = window.innerWidth
     || document.documentElement.clientWidth
     || document.body.clientWidth;

     var height = window.innerHeight
     || document.documentElement.clientHeight
     || document.body.clientHeight;
     ```

174. ### Can you apply chaining on conditional operator

     Yes, you can apply chaining on conditional operators similar to if … else if … else if … else chain. The syntax is going to be as below,

     ```javascript
     function traceValue(someParam) {
         return condition1 ? value1
              : condition2 ? value2
              : condition3 ? value3
              : value4;
     }

     // The above conditional operator is equivalent to:

     function traceValue(someParam) {
         if (condition1) { return value1; }
         else if (condition2) { return value2; }
         else if (condition3) { return value3; }
         else { return value4; }
     }
     ```

24. ### What is memoization

    Memoization is a programming technique which attempts to increase a function’s performance by caching its previously computed results.  Each time a memoized function is called, its parameters are used to index the cache. If the data is present, then it can be returned, without executing the entire function. Otherwise the function is executed and then the result is added to the cache.
    Let's take an example of adding function with memoization,

    ```javascript
    const memoizAddition = () => {
      let cache = {};
     return (value) => {
      if (value in cache) {
       console.log('Fetching from cache');
       return cache[value]; // Here, cache.value cannot be used as property name starts with the number which is not a valid JavaScript  identifier. Hence, can only be accessed using the square bracket notation.
      }
      else {
       console.log('Calculating result');
       let result = value + 20;
       cache[value] = result;
       return result;
      }
     }
    }
    // returned function from memoizAddition
    const addition = memoizAddition();
    console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 calculated
    console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 cached
    ```

69. ### What is the purpose of double exclamation

    The double exclamation or negation(!!) ensures the resulting type is a boolean. If it was falsey (e.g. 0, null, undefined, etc.), it will be false, otherwise, true.
    For example, you can test IE version using this expression as below,

    ```javascript
    let isIE8 = false;
    isIE8 = !! navigator.userAgent.match(/MSIE 8.0/);
    console.log(isIE8); // returns true or false
    ```

    If you don't use this expression then it returns the original value.

    ```javascript
    console.log(navigator.userAgent.match(/MSIE 8.0/));  // returns either an Array or null
    ```

    **Note:** The expression !! is not an operator, but it is just twice of ! operator.

71. ### What is the typeof operator

    You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable. It returns the type of a variable or an expression.

    ```javascript
    typeof "John Abraham"     // Returns "string"
    typeof (1 + 2)        // Returns "number"
    ```

75. ### What is eval

    The eval() function evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string. The string can be a JavaScript expression, variable, statement, or sequence of statements.

    ```javascript
    console.log(eval('1 + 2')); //  3
    ```

84. ### What is the purpose of isFinite function

    The isFinite() function is used to determine whether a number is a finite, legal number. It returns false if the value is +infinity, -infinity, or NaN (Not-a-Number), otherwise it returns true.

    ```javascript
    isFinite(Infinity);  // false
    isFinite(NaN);       // false
    isFinite(-Infinity); // false

    isFinite(100);         // true
    ```

137. ### How do you assign default values to variables

     You can use the logical or operator `||` in an assignment expression to provide a default value. The syntax looks like as below,

     ```javascript
     var a = b || c;
     ```

     As per the above expression, variable 'a 'will get the value of 'c' only if 'b' is falsy (if is null, false, undefined, 0, empty string, or NaN), otherwise 'a' will get the value of 'b'.

145. ### What are the benefits of keeping declarations at the top

     It is recommended to keep all declarations at the top of each script or function. The benefits of doing this are,
     1. Gives cleaner code
     2. It provides a single place to look for local variables
     3. Easy to avoid unwanted global variables
     4. It reduces the possibility of unwanted re-declarations

     An operator is capable of manipulating(mathematical and logical computations) a certain value or operand. There are various operators supported by JavaScript as below,
     1. **Arithmetic Operators:** Includes + (Addition),– (Subtraction), * (Multiplication), / (Division), % (Modulus), + + (Increment)  and – – (Decrement)
     2. **Comparison Operators:** Includes = =(Equal),!= (Not Equal), ===(Equal with type), > (Greater than),> = (Greater than or Equal to),< (Less than),<= (Less than or Equal to)
     3. **Logical Operators:** Includes &&(Logical AND),||(Logical OR),!(Logical NOT)
     4. **Assignment Operators:** Includes = (Assignment Operator), += (Add and Assignment Operator), – = (Subtract and Assignment Operator), *= (Multiply and Assignment), /= (Divide and Assignment), %= (Modules and Assignment)
     5. **Ternary Operators:** It includes conditional(: ?) Operator
     6. **typeof Operator:** It uses to find type of variable. The syntax looks like `typeof variable`

     Rest parameter is an improved way to handle function parameters which allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. The syntax would be as below,

     ```javascript
     function f(a, b, ...theArgs) {
       // ...
     }
     ```

     For example, let's take a sum example to calculate on dynamic number of parameters,

     ```javascript
     function total(…args){
     let sum = 0;
     for(let i of args){
     sum+=i;
     }
     return sum;
     }
     console.log(fun(1,2)); //3
     console.log(fun(1,2,3)); //6
     console.log(fun(1,2,3,4)); //13
     console.log(fun(1,2,3,4,5)); //15
     ```

     **Note:** Rest parameter is added in ES2015 or ES6

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

186. ### What happens if you do not use rest parameter as a last argument

     The rest parameter should be the last argument, as its job is to collect all the remaining arguments into an array. For example, if you define a function like below it doesn’t make any sense and will throw an error.

     ```javascript
     function someFunc(a,…b,c){
     //You code goes here
     return;
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

188. ### What is a spread operator

     Spread operator allows iterables( arrays / objects / strings ) to be expanded into single arguments/elements. Let's take an example to see this behavior,

     ```javascript
     function calculateSum(x, y, z) {
       return x + y + z;
     }

     const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

     console.log(calculateSum(...numbers)); // 6
     ```

248. ### How do you get metadata of a module

     You can use the `import.meta` object which is a meta-property exposing context-specific meta data to a JavaScript module. It contains information about the current module, such as the module's URL. In browsers, you might get different meta data than NodeJS.

     ```javascript
     <script type="module" src="welcome-module.js"></script>
     console.log(import.meta); // { url: "file:///home/user/welcome-module.js" }
     ```

309. ### What are template literals

     Template literals or template strings are string literals allowing embedded expressions. These are enclosed by the back-tick (`) character instead of double or single quotes.
     In E6, this feature enables using dynamic expressions as below,

     ```javascript
     var greeting = `Welcome to JS World, Mr. ${firstName} ${lastName}.`
     ```

     In ES5, you need break string like below,

     ```javascript
     var greeting = 'Welcome to JS World, Mr. ' + firstName + ' ' + lastName.`
     ```

     **Note:** You can use multi-line strings and string interpolation features with template literals.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

311. ### What are nesting templates

     The nesting template is a feature supported within template literals syntax to allow inner backticks inside a placeholder ${ } within the template. For example, the below nesting template is used to display the icons based on user permissions whereas outer template checks for platform type,

     ```javascript
     const iconStyles = `icon ${ isMobilePlatform() ? '' :
      `icon-${user.isAuthorized ? 'submit' : 'disabled'}` }`;
     ```

     You can write the above use case without nesting template features as well. However, the nesting template feature is more compact and readable.

     ```javascript
     //Without nesting templates
      const iconStyles = `icon ${ isMobilePlatform() ? '' :
       (user.isAuthorized ? 'icon-submit' : 'icon-disabled'}`;
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

323. ### What is for...of statement

     The for...of statement creates a loop iterating over iterable objects or elements such as built-in String, Array, Array-like objects (like arguments or NodeList), TypedArray, Map, Set, and user-defined iterables. The basic usage of for...of statement on arrays would be as below,

     ```javascript
     let arrayIterable = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

     for (let value of arrayIterable) {
       value ++;
       console.log(value); // 11 21 31 41 51
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
     
335. ### How do you convert character to ASCII code

     You can use the `String.prototype.charCodeAt()` method to convert string characters to ASCII numbers. For example, let's find ASCII code for the first letter of 'ABC' string,

     ```javascript
     "ABC".charCodeAt(0) // returns 65
     ```

     Whereas `String.fromCharCode()` method converts numbers to equal ASCII characters.

     ```javascript
     String.fromCharCode(65,66,67); // returns 'ABC'
     ```

### DOM

88. ### How do you submit a form using JavaScript

    You can submit a form using `document.forms[0].submit()`. All the form input's information is submitted using onsubmit event handler

    ```javascript
    function submit() {
        document.forms[0].submit();
    }
    ```

91. ### What is the difference between native, host and user objects

    `Native objects` are objects that are part of the JavaScript language defined by the ECMAScript specification. For example, String, Math, RegExp, Object, Function etc core objects defined in the ECMAScript spec.
    `Host objects` are objects provided by the browser or runtime environment (Node). For example, window, XmlHttpRequest, DOM nodes etc are considered as host objects.
    `User objects` are objects defined in the javascript code. For example, User objects created for profile information.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
    
94. ### What is the difference between an attribute and a property

    Attributes are defined on the HTML markup whereas properties are defined on the DOM. For example, the below HTML element has 2 attributes type and value,

    ```javascript
    <input type="text" value="Name:">
    ```

    You can retrieve the attribute value as below,

    ```javascript
    const input = document.querySelector('input');
    console.log(input.getAttribute('value')); // Good morning
    console.log(input.value); // Good morning
    ```

    And after you change the value of the text field to "Good evening", it becomes like

    ```javascript
    console.log(input.getAttribute('value')); // Good morning
    console.log(input.value); // Good evening
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**    

100. ### What are events

     Events are "things" that happen to HTML elements. When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can `react` on these events. Some of the examples of HTML events are,

     1. Web page has finished loading
     2. Input field was changed
     3. Button was clicked

     Let's describe the behavior of click event for button element,

     ```javascript
     <!doctype html>
     <html>
      <head>
        <script>
          function greeting() {
            alert('Hello! Good morning');
          }
        </script>
      </head>
      <body>
        <button type="button" onclick="greeting()">Click me</button>
      </body>
     </html>
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

102. ### What is the use of preventDefault method

     The preventDefault() method cancels the event if it is cancelable, meaning that the default action or behaviour that belongs to the event will not occur. For example, prevent form submission when clicking on submit button and prevent opening the page URL when clicking on hyperlink are some common use cases.

     ```javascript
     document.getElementById("link").addEventListener("click", function(event){
      event.preventDefault();
     });
     ```

     **Note:** Remember that not all events are cancelable.

119. ### How do you redirect new page in javascript

     In vanilla javascript, you can redirect to a new page using the `location` property of window object. The syntax would be as follows,

     ```javascript
     function redirect() {
        window.location.href = 'newPage.html';
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

122. ### How do you get the current url with javascript

     You can use `window.location.href` expression to get the current url path and you can use the same expression for updating the URL too. You can also use `document.URL` for read-only purposes but this solution has issues in FF.

     ```javascript
     console.log('location.href', window.location.href); // Returns full URL
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

123. ### What are the various url properties of location object

     The below `Location` object properties can be used to access URL components of the page,
     1. href - The entire URL
     2. protocol - The protocol of the URL
     3. host - The hostname and port of the URL
     4. hostname - The hostname of the URL
     5. port - The port number in the URL
     6. pathname - The path name of the URL
     7. search - The query portion of the URL
     8. hash - The anchor portion of the URL

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

124. ### How do get query string values in javascript

     You can use URLSearchParams to get query string values in javascript. Let's see an example to get the client code value from URL query string,

     ```javascript
     const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
     const clientCode = urlParams.get('clientCode');
     ```

105. ### What is BOM

     The Browser Object Model (BOM) allows JavaScript to "talk to" the browser. It consists of the objects navigator, history, screen, location and document which are children of the window. The Browser Object Model is not standardized and can change based on different browsers.

109. ### What is an event delegation

     Event delegation is a technique for listening to events where you delegate a parent element as the listener for all of the events that happen inside it.

     For example, if you wanted to detect field changes in inside a specific form, you can use event delegation technique,

     ```javascript
     var form = document.querySelector('#registration-form');

     // Listen for changes to fields inside the form
     form.addEventListener('input', function (event) {

     // Log the field that was changed
     console.log(event.target);

     }, false);
     ```

161. ### How do you change the style of a HTML element

     You can change inline style or classname of a HTML element using javascript
     1. **Using style property:** You can modify inline style using style property

     ```javascript
     document.getElementById("title").style.fontSize = "30px";
     ```

     1. **Using ClassName property:** It is easy to modify element class using className property

     ```javascript
      document.getElementById("title").className = "custom-title";
      ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

284. ### How do I modify the url without reloading the page

     The `window.location.url` property will be helpful to modify the url but it reloads the page. HTML5 introduced the `history.pushState()` and `history.replaceState()` methods, which allow you to add and modify history entries, respectively. For example, you can use pushState as below,

     ```javascript
     window.history.pushState('page2', 'Title', '/page2.html');
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

295. ### What are the different methods to find HTML elements in DOM

     If you want to access any element in an HTML page, you need to start with accessing the document object. Later you can use any of the below methods to find the HTML element,
     1. document.getElementById(id): It finds an element by Id
     2. document.getElementsByTagName(name): It finds an element by tag name
     3. document.getElementsByClassName(name): It finds an element by class name

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### String 

120. ### How do you check whether a string contains a substring

     There are 3 possible ways to check whether a string contains a substring or not,
     1. **Using includes:** ES6 provided `String.prototype.includes` method to test a string contains a substring

     ```javascript
     var mainString = "hello", subString = "hell";
     mainString.includes(subString)
     ```

     1. **Using indexOf:** In an ES5 or older environment, you can use `String.prototype.indexOf` which returns the index of a substring. If the index value is not equal to -1 then it means the substring exists in the main string.

     ```javascript
     var mainString = "hello", subString = "hell";
     mainString.indexOf(subString) !== -1
     ```

     1. **Using RegEx:** The advanced solution is using Regular expression's test method(`RegExp.test`), which allows for testing for against regular expressions

     ```javascript
     var mainString = "hello", regex = /hell/;
     regex.test(mainString)
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

134. ### How do you trim a string in javascript

     JavaScript provided a trim method on string types to trim any whitespaces present at the beginning or ending of the string.

     ```javascript
     "  Hello World   ".trim(); //Hello World
     ```

     If your browser(<IE9) doesn't support this method then you can use below polyfill.

     ```javascript
     if (!String.prototype.trim) {
         (function() {
             // Make sure we trim BOM and NBSP
             var rtrim = /^[\s\uFEFF\xA0]+|[\s\uFEFF\xA0]+$/g;
             String.prototype.trim = function() {
                 return this.replace(rtrim, '');
             };
         })();
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

138. ### How do you define multiline strings

     You can define multiline string literals using the '\\' character followed by line terminator.

     ```javascript
     var str = "This is a \
     very lengthy \
     sentence!";
     ```

     But if you have a space after the '\\' character, the code will look exactly the same, but it will raise a SyntaxError.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

154. ### What is a Regular Expression

     A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. You can use this search pattern for searching data in a text. These can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations. Let's see the syntax format now,

     ```javascript
     /pattern/modifiers;
     ```

     For example, the regular expression or search pattern with case-insensitive username would be,

     ```javascript
     /John/i
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

155. ### What are the string methods available in Regular expression

     Regular Expressions has two string methods: search() and replace().
     The search() method uses an expression to search for a match, and returns the position of the match.

     ```javascript
     var msg = "Hello John";
     var n = msg.search(/John/i); // 6
     ```

     The replace() method is used to return a modified string where the pattern is replaced.

     ```javascript
     var msg = "Hello John";
     var n = msg.replace(/John/i, "Buttler"); // Hello Buttler
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

156. ### What are modifiers in regular expression

      Modifiers can be used to perform case-insensitive and global searches. Let's list down some of the modifiers,

      | Modifier | Description |
      |---- | ---------
      | i  | Perform case-insensitive matching |
      | g | Perform a global match rather than stops at first match  |
      | m | Perform multiline matching|

      Let's take an example of global modifier,

      ```javascript
      var text = "Learn JS one by one";
      var pattern = /one/g;
      var result = text.match(pattern); // one,one
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

157. ### What are regular expression patterns

     Regular Expressions provide a group of patterns in order to match characters. Basically they are categorized into 3 types,
     1. **Brackets:** These are used to find a range of characters.
        For example, below are some use cases,
        1. [abc]: Used to find any of the characters between the brackets(a,b,c)
        2. [0-9]: Used to find any of the digits between the brackets
        3. (a|b): Used to find any of the alternatives separated with |
     2. **Metacharacters:** These are characters with a special meaning
        For example, below are some use cases,
        1. \\d: Used to find a digit
        2. \\s: Used to find a whitespace character
        3. \\b: Used to find a match at the beginning or ending of a word
     3. **Quantifiers:** These are useful to define quantities
        For example, below are some use cases,
        1. n+: Used to find matches for any string that contains at least one n
        2. n*: Used to find matches for any string that contains zero or more occurrences of n
        3. n?: Used to find matches for any string that contains zero or one occurrences of n

158. ### What is a RegExp object

     RegExp object is a regular expression object with predefined properties and methods. Let's see the simple usage of RegExp object,

     ```javascript
     var regexp = new RegExp('\\w+');
     console.log(regexp);
     // expected output: /\w+/
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

159. ### How do you search a string for a pattern

     You can use the test() method of regular expression in order to search a string for a pattern, and return true or false depending on the result.

     ```javascript
     var pattern = /you/;
     console.log(pattern.test("How are you?")); //true
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

160. ### What is the purpose of exec method

     The purpose of exec method is similar to test method but it executes a search for a match in a specified string and returns a result array, or null instead of returning true/false.

     ```javascript
     var pattern = /you/;
     console.log(pattern.exec("How are you?")); //["you", index: 8, input: "How are you?", groups: undefined]
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

182. ### How to convert string to title case with javascript

     Title case means that the first letter of each word is capitalized. You can convert a string to title case using the below function,

     ```javascript
         function toTitleCase(str) {
             return str.replace(
                 /\w\S*/g,
                 function(txt) {
                     return txt.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + txt.substr(1).toLowerCase();
                 }
             );
         }
         toTitleCase("good morning john"); // Good Morning John
     ```

### objects

125. ### How do you check if a key exists in an object

     You can check whether a key exists in an object or not using three approaches,

     1. **Using in operator:** You can use the in operator whether a key exists in an object or not

     ```javascript
     "key" in obj
     ```

     and If you want to check if a key doesn't exist, remember to use parenthesis,

     ```javascript
     !("key" in obj)
     ```

     1. **Using hasOwnProperty method:** You can use `hasOwnProperty` to particularly test for properties of the object instance (and not inherited properties)

     ```javascript
     obj.hasOwnProperty("key") // true
     ```

     1. **Using undefined comparison:** If you access a non-existing property from an object, the result is undefined. Let’s compare the properties against undefined to determine the existence of the property.

     ```javascript
     const user = {
       name: 'John'
     };

     console.log(user.name !== undefined);     // true
     console.log(user.nickName !== undefined); // false
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

126. ### How do you loop through or enumerate javascript object

     You can use the `for-in` loop to loop through javascript object. You can also make sure that the key you get is an actual property of an object, and doesn't come from the prototype using `hasOwnProperty` method.

     ```javascript
     var object = {
         "k1": "value1",
         "k2": "value2",
         "k3": "value3"
     };

     for (var key in object) {
         if (object.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
             console.log(key + " -> " + object[key]); // k1 -> value1 ...
         }
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

127. ### How do you test for an empty object

     There are different solutions based on ECMAScript versions
     1. **Using Object entries(ECMA 7+):** You can use object entries length along with constructor type.

     ```javascript
     Object.entries(obj).length === 0 && obj.constructor === Object // Since date object length is 0, you need to check constructor check as well
     ```

     1. **Using Object keys(ECMA 5+):** You can use object keys length along with constructor type.

     ```javascript
     Object.keys(obj).length === 0 && obj.constructor === Object // Since date object length is 0, you need to check constructor check as well
     ```

     1. **Using for-in with hasOwnProperty(Pre-ECMA 5):** You can use a for-in loop along with hasOwnProperty.

     ```javascript
     function isEmpty(obj) {
       for(var prop in obj) {
         if(obj.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
           return false;
         }
       }

       return JSON.stringify(obj) === JSON.stringify({});
     }
     ```

128. ### What is an arguments object

     The arguments object is an Array-like object accessible inside functions that contains the values of the arguments passed to that function. For example, let's see how to use arguments object inside sum function,

     ```javascript
     function sum() {
         var total = 0;
         for (var i = 0, len = arguments.length; i < len; ++i) {
             total += arguments[i];
         }
         return total;
     }

     sum(1, 2, 3) // returns 6
     ```

     **Note:** You can't apply array methods on arguments object. But you can convert into a regular array as below.

     ```javascript
     var argsArray = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

135. ### How do you add a key value pair in javascript

     There are two possible solutions to add new properties to an object. Let's take a simple object to explain these solutions.

     ```javascript
     var object = {
         key1: value1,
         key2: value2
     };
     ```

     1. **Using dot notation:** This solution is useful when you know the name of the property

     ```javascript
     object.key3 = "value3";
     ```

     1. **Using square bracket notation:** This solution is useful when the name of the property is dynamically determined.

     ```javascript
     obj["key3"] = "value3";
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

176. ### What is the difference between proto and prototype

     The `__proto__` object is the actual object that is used in the lookup chain to resolve methods, etc. Whereas `prototype` is the object that is used to build `__proto__` when you create an object with new

     ```javascript
     ( new Employee ).__proto__ === Employee.prototype;
     ( new Employee ).prototype === undefined;
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

178. ### What is a freeze method

     The **freeze()** method is used to freeze an object. Freezing an object does not allow adding new properties to an object,prevents from removing and prevents changing the enumerability, configurability, or writability of existing properties. i.e, It returns the passed object and does not create a frozen copy.

     ```javascript
     const obj = {
       prop: 100
     };

     Object.freeze(obj);
     obj.prop = 200; // Throws an error in strict mode

     console.log(obj.prop); //100
     ```

     **Note:** It causes a TypeError if the argument passed is not an object.

179. ### What is the purpose of freeze method

     Below are the main benefits of using freeze method,

     1. It is used for freezing objects and arrays.
     2. It is used to make an object immutable.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

180. ### Why do I need to use freeze method

     In the Object-oriented paradigm, an existing API contains certain elements that are not intended to be extended, modified, or re-used outside of their current context. Hence it works as the `final` keyword which is used in various languages.

189. ### How do you determine whether object is frozen or not

     Object.isFrozen() method is used to determine if an object is frozen or not.An object is frozen if all of the below conditions hold true,
     1. If it is not extensible.
     2. If all of its properties are non-configurable.
     3. If all its data properties are non-writable.
     The usage is going to be as follows,

     ```javascript
     const object = {
        property: 'Welcome JS world'
     };
     Object.freeze(object);
     console.log(Object.isFrozen(object));
     ```

190. ### How do you determine two values same or not using object

     The Object.is() method determines whether two values are the same value. For example, the usage with different types of values would be,

     ```javascript
     Object.is('hello', 'hello');     // true
     Object.is(window, window);   // true
     Object.is([], []) // false
     ```

     Two values are the same if one of the following holds:
     1. both undefined
     2. both null
     3. both true or both false
     4. both strings of the same length with the same characters in the same order
     5. both the same object (means both object have same reference)
     6. both numbers and
        both +0
        both -0
        both NaN
        both non-zero and both not NaN and both have the same value.

191. ### What is the purpose of using object is method

     Some of the applications of Object's `is` method are follows,
     1. It is used for comparison of two strings.
     2. It is used for comparison of two numbers.
     3. It is used for comparing the polarity of two numbers.
     4. It is used for comparison of two objects.

192. ### How do you copy properties from one object to other

     You can use the Object.assign() method which is used to copy the values and properties from one or more source objects to a target object.  It returns the target object which has properties and values copied from the target object. The syntax would be as below,

     ```javascript
     Object.assign(target, ...sources)
     ```

     Let's take example with one source and one target object,

     ```javascript
     const target = { a: 1, b: 2 };
     const source = { b: 3, c: 4 };

     const returnedTarget = Object.assign(target, source);

     console.log(target); // { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }

     console.log(returnedTarget); // { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }
     ```

     As observed in the above code, there is a common property(`b`) from source to target so it's value has been overwritten.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

193. ### What are the applications of assign method

     Below are the some of main applications of Object.assign() method,

     1. It is used for cloning an object.
     2. It is used to merge objects with the same properties.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

195. ### What is the purpose of seal method

     The **Object.seal()** method is used to seal an object, by preventing new properties from being added to it and marking all existing properties as non-configurable. But values of present properties can still be changed as long as they are writable. Let's see the below example to understand more about seal() method

     ```javascript
      const object = {
         property: 'Welcome JS world'
      };
      Object.seal(object);
      object.property = 'Welcome to object world';
      console.log(Object.isSealed(object)); // true
      delete object.property; // You cannot delete when sealed
      console.log(object.property); //Welcome to object world
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

196. ### What are the applications of seal method

     Below are the main applications of Object.seal() method,
     1. It is used for sealing objects and arrays.
     2. It is used to make an object immutable.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

197. ### What are the differences between freeze and seal methods

     If an object is frozen using the Object.freeze() method then its properties become immutable and no changes can be made in them whereas if an object is sealed using the Object.seal() method then the changes can be made in the existing properties of the object.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

198. ### How do you determine if an object is sealed or not

     The Object.isSealed() method is used to determine if an object is sealed or not. An object is sealed if all of the below conditions hold true
     1. If it is not extensible.
     2. If all of its properties are non-configurable.
     3. If it is not removable (but not necessarily non-writable).
     Let's see it in the action

     ```javascript
     const object = {
     property: 'Hello, Good morning'
     };

     Object.seal(object); // Using seal() method to seal the object

     console.log(Object.isSealed(object));      // checking whether the object is sealed or not
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

199. ### How do you get enumerable key and value pairs

     The Object.entries() method is used to return an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs, in the same order as that provided by a for...in loop. Let's see the functionality of object.entries() method in an example,

     ```javascript
     const object = {
       a: 'Good morning',
       b: 100
     };

     for (let [key, value] of Object.entries(object)) {
       console.log(`${key}: ${value}`); // a: 'Good morning'
                                        // b: 100
     }
     ```

     **Note:** The order is not guaranteed as object defined.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

200. ### What is the main difference between Object.values and Object.entries method

     The Object.values() method's behavior is similar to Object.entries() method but it returns an array of values instead [key,value] pairs.

     ```javascript
      const object = {
        a: 'Good morning',
        b: 100
      };

      for (let value of Object.values(object)) {
        console.log(`${value}`); // 'Good morning'
                                     100
      }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

201. ### How can you get the list of keys of any object

     You can use the `Object.keys()` method which is used to return an array of a given object's own property names, in the same order as we get with a normal loop. For example, you can get the keys of a user object,

     ```javascript
     const user = {
       name: 'John',
       gender: 'male',
       age: 40
     };

     console.log(Object.keys(user)); //['name', 'gender', 'age']
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

202. ### How do you create an object with prototype

     The Object.create() method is used to create a new object with the specified prototype object and properties. i.e, It uses an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object. It returns a new object with the specified prototype object and properties.

     ```javascript
      const user = {
        name: 'John',
        printInfo: function () {
          console.log(`My name is ${this.name}.`);
        }
      };

      const admin = Object.create(user);

      admin.name = "Nick"; // Remember that "name" is a property set on "admin" but not on "user" object

      admin.printInfo(); // My name is Nick
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

216. ### What are javascript accessors

     ECMAScript 5 introduced javascript object accessors or computed properties through getters and setters. Getters uses the `get` keyword whereas Setters uses the `set` keyword.

     ```javascript
     var user = {
       firstName: "John",
       lastName : "Abraham",
       language : "en",
       get lang() {
         return this.language;
       }
       set lang(lang) {
       this.language = lang;
       }
     };
     console.log(user.lang); // getter access lang as en
     user.lang = 'fr';
     console.log(user.lang); // setter used to set lang as fr
     ```

217. ### How do you define property on Object constructor

     The Object.defineProperty() static method is used to define a new property directly on an object, or modify an existing property on an object, and returns the object. Let's see an example to know how to define property,

     ```javascript
     const newObject = {};

     Object.defineProperty(newObject, 'newProperty', {
       value: 100,
       writable: false
     });

     console.log(newObject.newProperty); // 100

     newObject.newProperty = 200; // It throws an error in strict mode due to writable setting

     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

258. ### How do you get the prototype of an object

     You can use the `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)` method to return the prototype of the specified object. i.e. The value of the internal `prototype` property. If there are no inherited properties then `null` value is returned.

     ```javascript
     const newPrototype = {};
     const newObject = Object.create(newPrototype);

     console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(newObject) === newPrototype); // true
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

259. ### What happens If I pass string type for getPrototype method

     In ES5, it will throw a TypeError exception if the obj parameter isn't an object. Whereas in ES2015, the parameter will be coerced to an `Object`.

     ```javascript
     // ES5
     Object.getPrototypeOf('James'); // TypeError: "James" is not an object
     // ES2015
     Object.getPrototypeOf('James'); // String.prototype
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

260. ### How do you set prototype of one object to another

     You can use the `Object.setPrototypeOf()` method that sets the prototype (i.e., the internal `Prototype` property) of a specified object to another object or null. For example, if you want to set prototype of a square object to rectangle object would be as follows,

     ```javascript
     Object.setPrototypeOf(Square.prototype, Rectangle.prototype);
     Object.setPrototypeOf({}, null);
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

261. ### How do you check whether an object can be extendable or not

     The `Object.isExtensible()` method is used to determine if an object is extendable or not. i.e, Whether it can have new properties added to it or not.

     ```javascript
     const newObject = {};
     console.log(Object.isExtensible(newObject)); //true
     ```

     **Note:** By default, all the objects are extendable. i.e, The new properties can be added or modified.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

262. ### How do you prevent an object to extend

     The `Object.preventExtensions()` method is used to prevent new properties from ever being added to an object. In other words, it prevents future extensions to the object. Let's see the usage of this property,

     ```javascript
     const newObject = {};
     Object.preventExtensions(newObject); // NOT extendable

     try {
       Object.defineProperty(newObject, 'newProperty', { // Adding new property
         value: 100
       });
     } catch (e) {
       console.log(e); // TypeError: Cannot define property newProperty, object is not extensible
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

263. ### What are the different ways to make an object non-extensible

     You can mark an object non-extensible in 3 ways,
     1. Object.preventExtensions
     2. Object.seal
     3. Object.freeze

     ```javascript
     var newObject = {};

     Object.preventExtensions(newObject); // Prevent objects are non-extensible
     Object.isExtensible(newObject); // false

     var sealedObject = Object.seal({}); // Sealed objects are non-extensible
     Object.isExtensible(sealedObject); // false

     var frozenObject = Object.freeze({}); // Frozen objects are non-extensible
     Object.isExtensible(frozenObject); // false
     ```

264. ### How do you define multiple properties on an object

     The `Object.defineProperties()` method is used to define new or modify existing properties directly on an object and returning the object. Let's define multiple properties on an empty object,

     ```javascript
     const newObject = {};

     Object.defineProperties(newObject, {
       newProperty1: {
         value: 'John',
         writable: true
       },
       newProperty2: {}
     });
     ```

### functions

140. ### Can we define properties for functions

     Yes, We can define properties for functions because functions are also objects.

     ```javascript
     fn = function(x) {
        //Function code goes here
     }

     fn.name = "John";

     fn.profile = function(y) {
       //Profile code goes here
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

141. ### What is the way to find the number of parameters expected by a function

     You can use `function.length` syntax to find the number of parameters expected by a function. Let's take an example of `sum` function to calculate the sum of numbers,

     ```javascript
     function sum(num1, num2, num3, num4){
         return num1 + num2 + num3 + num4;
     }
     sum.length // 4 is the number of parameters expected.
     ```

402. ### What is the difference between Function constructor and function declaration

     The functions which are created with `Function constructor` do not create closures to their creation contexts but they are always created in the global scope. i.e, the function can access its own local variables and global scope variables only. Whereas function declarations can access outer function variables(closures) too.

     Let's see this difference with an example,

     **Function Constructor:**

     ```javascript
     var a = 100;
     function createFunction() {
         var a = 200;
         return new Function('return a;');
     }
     console.log(createFunction()()); // 100
     ```

     **Function declaration:**

     ```javascript
     var a = 100;
     function createFunction() {
         var a = 200;
         return function func() {
             return a;
         }
     }
     console.log(createFunction()()); // 200
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

406. ### What is the difference between function and class declarations

     The main difference between function declarations and class declarations is `hoisting`. The function declarations are hoisted but not class declarations.

     **Classes:**

     ```javascript
     const user = new User(); // ReferenceError

     class User {}
     ```

     **Constructor Function:**

     ```javascript
      const user = new User(); // No error

      function User() {
      }
     ```

### time

106. ### What is the use of setTimeout

     The setTimeout() method is used to call a function or evaluate an expression after a specified number of milliseconds. For example, let's log a message after 2 seconds using setTimeout method,

     ```javascript
     setTimeout(function(){ console.log("Good morning"); }, 2000);
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

107. ### What is the use of setInterval

     The setInterval() method is used to call a function or evaluate an expression at specified intervals (in milliseconds). For example, let's log a message after 2 seconds using setInterval method,

     ```javascript
     setInterval(function(){ console.log("Good morning"); }, 2000);
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

117. ### What is the purpose of clearTimeout method

     The clearTimeout() function is used in javascript to clear the timeout which has been set by setTimeout()function before that. i.e, The return value of setTimeout() function is stored in a variable and it’s passed into the clearTimeout() function to clear the timer.

     For example, the below setTimeout method is used to display the message after 3 seconds. This timeout can be cleared by the clearTimeout() method.

     ```javascript
     <script>
     var msg;
     function greeting() {
        alert('Good morning');
     }
     function start() {
       msg =setTimeout(greeting, 3000);

     }

     function stop() {
         clearTimeout(msg);
     }
     </script>
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

118. ### What is the purpose of clearInterval method

     The clearInterval() function is used in javascript to clear the interval which has been set by setInterval() function. i.e, The return value returned by setInterval() function is stored in a variable and it’s passed into the clearInterval() function to clear the interval.

     For example, the below setInterval method is used to display the message for every 3 seconds. This interval can be cleared by the clearInterval() method.

     ```javascript
     <script>
     var msg;
     function greeting() {
        alert('Good morning');
     }
     function start() {
       msg = setInterval(greeting, 3000);

     }

     function stop() {
         clearInterval(msg);
     }
     </script>
     ```

131. ### How do you display the current date in javascript

     You can use `new Date()` to generate a new Date object containing the current date and time. For example, let's display the current date in mm/dd/yyyy

     ```javascript
     var today = new Date();
     var dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0');
     var mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); //January is 0!
     var yyyy = today.getFullYear();

     today = mm + '/' + dd + '/' + yyyy;
     document.write(today);
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

132. ### How do you compare two date objects

     You need to use date.getTime() method to compare date values instead of comparison operators (==, !=, ===, and !== operators)

     ```javascript
     var d1 = new Date();
     var d2 = new Date(d1);
     console.log(d1.getTime() === d2.getTime()); //True
     console.log(d1 === d2); // False
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

171. ### How do you convert date to another timezone in javascript

     You can use the toLocaleString() method to convert dates in one timezone to another. For example, let's convert current date to British English timezone as below,

     ```javascript
     console.log(event.toLocaleString('en-GB', { timeZone: 'UTC' })); //29/06/2019, 09:56:00
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

293. ### How do get the timezone offset from date

     You can use the `getTimezoneOffset` method of the date object. This method returns the time zone difference, in minutes, from current locale (host system settings) to UTC

     ```javascript
     var offset = new Date().getTimezoneOffset();
     console.log(offset); // -480
     ```

429. ### What is the difference between setTimeout, setImmediate and process.nextTick?

     1. **Set Timeout:** setTimeout() is to schedule execution of a one-time callback after delay milliseconds.
     2. **Set Immediate:** The setImmediate function is used to execute a function right after the current event loop finishes.
     3. **Process NextTick:**  If process.nextTick() is called in a given phase, all the callbacks passed to process.nextTick() will be resolved before the event loop continues. This will block the event loop and create I/O Starvation if process.nextTick() is called recursively.

### math

149. ### How do you generate random integers

     You can use Math.random() with Math.floor() to return random integers. For example, if you want generate random integers between 1 to 10, the multiplication factor should be 10,

     ```javascript
     Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;     // returns a random integer from 1 to 10
     Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;     // returns a random integer from 1 to 100
     ```

     **Note:** Math.random() returns a random number between 0 (inclusive),  and 1 (exclusive)

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

150. ### Can you write a random integers function to print integers with in a range

     Yes, you can create a proper random function to return a random number between min and max (both included)

     ```javascript
     function randomInteger(min, max) {
       return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1) ) + min;
     }
     randomInteger(1, 100); // returns a random integer from 1 to 100
     randomInteger(1, 1000); // returns a random integer from 1 to 1000
     ```

### array

243. ### What is the purpose of compareFunction while sorting arrays

     The compareFunction is used to define the sort order. If omitted, the array elements are converted to strings, then sorted according to each character's Unicode code point value. Let's take an example to see the usage of compareFunction,

     ```javascript
     let numbers = [1, 2, 5, 3, 4];
     numbers.sort((a, b) => b - a);
     console.log(numbers); // [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

     You can use length and every method of arrays to compare two scalar(compared directly using ===) arrays. The combination of these expressions can give the expected result,

     ```javascript
     const arrayFirst = [1,2,3,4,5];
     const arraySecond = [1,2,3,4,5];
     console.log(arrayFirst.length === arraySecond.length && arrayFirst.every((value, index) => value === arraySecond[index])); // true
     ````

     If you would like to compare arrays irrespective of order then you should sort them before,

     ```javascript
     const arrayFirst = [2,3,1,4,5];
     const arraySecond = [1,2,3,4,5];
     console.log(arrayFirst.length === arraySecond.length && arrayFirst.sort().every((value, index) => value === arraySecond[index])); //true
     ````

360. ### How do you remove falsy values from an array

     You can apply the filter method on the array by passing Boolean as a parameter. This way it removes all falsy values(0, undefined, null, false and "") from the array.

     ```javascript
     const myArray = [false, null, 1,5, undefined]
     myArray.filter(Boolean); // [1, 5] // is same as myArray.filter(x => x);
     ```

366. ### What is the easiest way to convert an array to an object

     You can convert an array to an object with the same data using spread(...) operator.

     ```javascript
     var fruits = ["banana", "apple", "orange", "watermelon"];
     var fruitsObject = {...fruits};
     console.log(fruitsObject); // {0: "banana", 1: "apple", 2: "orange", 3: "watermelon"}
     ```

418. ### What are the differences between for...of and for...in statements

     Both for...in and for...of statements iterate over js data structures. The only difference is over what they iterate:

     1. for..in iterates over all enumerable property keys of an object
     2. for..of iterates over the values of an iterable object.

     Let's explain this difference with an example,

     ```javascript
     let arr = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

     arr.newProp = 'newVlue';

     // key are the property keys
     for (let key in arr) {
       console.log(key);
     }

     // value are the property values
     for (let value of arr) {
       console.log(value);
     }
     ```

     Since for..in loop iterates over the keys of the object, the first loop logs 0, 1, 2 and newProp while iterating over the array object. The for..of loop iterates over the values of a arr data structure and logs  a, b, c in the console.

### typescript

251. ### What is typescript

      TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript created by Microsoft that adds optional types, classes, async/await, and many other features, and compiles to plain JavaScript. Angular built entirely in TypeScript and used as a primary language. You can install it globally as

      ```bash
      npm install -g typescript
      ```

      Let's see a simple example of TypeScript usage,

      ```typescript
      function greeting(name: string): string {
         return "Hello, " + name;
      }

      let user = "Sudheer";

      console.log(greeting(user));
      ```

      The greeting method allows only string type as argument.

252. ### What are the differences between javascript and typescript

     Below are the list of differences between javascript and typescript,

     | feature | typescript | javascript |
     |---- | --------- | ----
     | Language paradigm  | Object oriented programming language  | Scripting language |
     | Typing support | Supports static typing  | It has dynamic typing |
     | Modules | Supported | Not supported |
     | Interface | It has interfaces concept | Doesn't support interfaces |
     | Optional parameters | Functions support optional parameters | No support of optional parameters for functions |

253. ### What are the advantages of typescript over javascript

     Below are some of the advantages of typescript over javascript,
     1. TypeScript is able to find compile time errors at the development time only and it makes sures less runtime errors. Whereas javascript is an interpreted language.
     2. TypeScript is strongly-typed or supports static typing which allows for checking type correctness at compile time. This is not available in javascript.
     3. TypeScript compiler can compile the .ts files into ES3,ES4 and ES5 unlike ES6 features of javascript which may not be supported in some browsers.

### class

26. ### What are classes in ES6

    In ES6, Javascript classes are primarily syntactic sugar over JavaScript’s existing prototype-based inheritance.
    For example, the prototype based inheritance written in function expression as below,

    ```javascript
    function Bike(model,color) {
        this.model = model;
        this.color = color;
    }

    Bike.prototype.getDetails = function() {
        return this.model + ' bike has' + this.color + ' color';
    };
    ```

    Whereas ES6 classes can be defined as an alternative

    ```javascript
    class Bike{
      constructor(color, model) {
        this.color= color;
        this.model= model;
      }

      getDetails() {
        return this.model + ' bike has' + this.color + ' color';
      }
    }
    ```

255. ### What is a constructor method

     The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created within a class. If you do not specify a constructor method, a default constructor is used. The example usage of constructor would be as below,

     ```javascript
     class Employee {
       constructor() {
         this.name = "John";
       }
     }

     var employeeObject = new Employee();

     console.log(employeeObject.name); // John
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

256. ### What happens if you write constructor more than once in a class

     The "constructor" in a class is a special method and it should be defined only once in a class. i.e, If you write a constructor method more than once in a class it will throw a `SyntaxError` error.

     ```javascript
      class Employee {
        constructor() {
          this.name = "John";
        }
        constructor() {   //  Uncaught SyntaxError: A class may only have one constructor
          this.age = 30;
        }
      }

      var employeeObject = new Employee();

      console.log(employeeObject.name);
     ```

257. ### How do you call the constructor of a parent class

     You can use the `super` keyword to call the constructor of a parent class. Remember that `super()` must be called before using 'this' reference. Otherwise it will cause a reference error. Let's the usage of it,

     ```javascript
     class Square extends Rectangle {
       constructor(length) {
         super(length, length);
         this.name = 'Square';
       }

       get area() {
         return this.width * this.height;
       }

       set area(value) {
         this.area = value;
       }
     }
     ```

283. ### How do you extend classes

     The `extends` keyword is used in class declarations/expressions to create a class which is a child of another class. It can be used to subclass custom classes as well as built-in objects. The syntax would be as below,

     ```javascript
     class ChildClass extends ParentClass { ... }
     ```

     Let's take an example of Square subclass from Polygon parent class,

     ```javascript
      class Square extends Rectangle {
        constructor(length) {
          super(length, length);
          this.name = 'Square';
        }

        get area() {
          return this.width * this.height;
        }

        set area(value) {
          this.area = value;
        }
      }
     ```

### async

381. ### What is AJAX

     AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML and it is a group of related technologies(HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XMLHttpRequest API etc) used to display data asynchronously. i.e. We can send data to the server and get data from the server without reloading the web page.

382. ### What are the different ways to deal with Asynchronous Code

     Below are the list of different ways to deal with Asynchronous code.
     1. Callbacks
     2. Promises
     3. Async/await
     4. Third-party libraries such as async.js,bluebird etc

383. ### How to cancel a fetch request

     Until a few days back, One shortcoming of native promises is no direct way to cancel a fetch request. But the new `AbortController` from js specification allows you to use a signal to abort one or multiple fetch calls.
     The basic flow of cancelling a fetch request would be as below,
     1. Create an `AbortController` instance
     2. Get the signal property of an instance and pass the signal as a fetch option for signal
     3. Call the AbortController's abort property to cancel all fetches that use that signal
     For example, let's pass the same signal to multiple fetch calls will cancel all requests with that signal,

     ```javascript
     const controller = new AbortController();
     const { signal } = controller;

     fetch("http://localhost:8000", { signal }).then(response => {
         console.log(`Request 1 is complete!`);
     }).catch(e => {
         if(e.name === "AbortError") {
             // We know it's been canceled!
         }
     });

     fetch("http://localhost:8000", { signal }).then(response => {
         console.log(`Request 2 is complete!`);
     }).catch(e => {
          if(e.name === "AbortError") {
              // We know it's been canceled!
           }
     });

     // Wait 2 seconds to abort both requests
     setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 2000);
     ```

384. ### What is web speech API

     Web speech API is used to enable modern browsers recognize and synthesize speech(i.e, voice data into web apps). This API has been introduced by W3C Community in the year 2012. It has two main parts,
     1. **SpeechRecognition (Asynchronous Speech Recognition or Speech-to-Text):** It provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input and respond accordingly. This is accessed by the `SpeechRecognition` interface.
     The below example shows on how to use this API to get text from speech,

     ```javascript
     window.SpeechRecognition = window.webkitSpeechRecognition || window.SpeechRecognition;  // webkitSpeechRecognition for Chrome and SpeechRecognition for FF
     const recognition = new window.SpeechRecognition();
     recognition.onresult = (event) => { // SpeechRecognitionEvent type
       const speechToText = event.results[0][0].transcript;
       console.log(speechToText);
     }
     recognition.start();
     ```

     In this API, browser is going to ask you for permission to use your microphone
     1. **SpeechSynthesis (Text-to-Speech):** It provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input and respond. This is accessed by the `SpeechSynthesis` interface.
     For example, the below code is used to get voice/speech from text,

     ```javascript
     if('speechSynthesis' in window){
         var speech = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance('Hello World!');
         speech.lang = 'en-US';
         window.speechSynthesis.speak(speech);
     }
     ```

     The above examples can be tested on chrome(33+) browser's developer console.
     **Note:**  This API is still a working draft and only available in Chrome and Firefox browsers(ofcourse Chrome only implemented the specification)

407. ### What is an async function

     An async function is a function declared with the `async` keyword which enables asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style by avoiding promise chains. These functions can contain zero or more `await` expressions.

     Let's take a below async function example,

     ```javascript
     async function logger() {

       let data = await fetch('http://someapi.com/users'); // pause until fetch returns
       console.log(data)
     }
     logger();
     ```

     It is basically syntax sugar over ES2015 promises and generators.
