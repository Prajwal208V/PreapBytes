                We have two different way for doing function expression in JavaScript:
                1.Named function expression (NFE):
                  var boo = function boo (){///}
                2.Anonymous function expression:
                  var boo=function (){///}
            The arrow function expression (=>)
                  var boo=()=>{///}
            The Function constructor.

              It is a design pattern which is also known as a Self-Executing Anonymous Function 
              and contains two major parts:
              1.The first is the anonymous function with lexical scope enclosed within the Grouping Operator ().
                This prevents accessing variables within the IIFE idiom as well as polluting the global scope.
              2.The second part creates the immediately invoked function expression () through which 
                the JavaScript engine will directly interpret the function.

        Higher order functions are functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as 
        arguments or by returning them.{A Higher-Order function is a function that receives a function 
        as an argument or returns the function as output.}

        For example:- Array.prototype.map, Array.prototype.filter and Array.prototype.reduce are some 
        of the Higher-Order functions built into the language.*/

            https://medium.com/@fotios.floros/explaining-javascript-callbacks-3d5a9ad52819
            A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside
            the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.
            In Javascript every function is a first class object, which means that every function is an
            Object and can be used like any other object(String, Number etc.).
            This allows the use of a function as a parameter in another function which is the fundamental
            idea of callback functions.
            when passing a callback function as a parameter to another function we are only passing the 
            callback function definition.
            These are the main aspects of callback function:
                1.Use anonymous functions as callbacks
                2.Use named functions as callbacks
                3.Parameters to callback functions    ❌
                4.Multiple callback functions        ❌

            console.log(index+1+". "+fruit);
