### Node.js and Where can you use it 
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

Where can you use it ? Node.js is perfect for data-intensive applications as it uses an asynchronous, event-driven model.we can use I/O intensive web applications     like video streaming sites.we can also use it for developing: 
Real-time web applications,
Network applications,
General-purpose applications and 
Distributed systems.

### event-loop
in Node JS:Event loops handle asynchronous callbacks in Node.js. It is the foundation of the non-blocking input/output in Node.js, 
Node.js overcome the problem of blocking of I/O operations.
the node has an event-loop that can be used to handle all asynchronous operation without blocking the main function. 
So for example, if some network call needs to happen it will be scheduled in the event loop instead of the main thread(single thread). And if there are multiple such   I/O calls each one will be queued accordingly to be executed separately(other than the main thread). Thus even though we have single-threaded JS, I/O ops are handled   in a nonblocking way.
  
### Node.js work

1.Clients send requests to the webserver to interact with the web application. Requests can be non-blocking or blocking:post Querying for data,Deleting data,Updating     the data,
2.Node.js retrieves the incoming requests and adds those to the Event Queue
3.The requests are then passed one-by-one through the Event Loop. It checks if the requests are simple enough not to require any external resources.
4.The Event Loop processes simple requests (non-blocking operations), such as I/O Polling, and returns the responses to the corresponding clients
5.A single thread from the Thread Pool is assigned to a single complex request. This thread is responsible for completing a particular blocking request by accessing     external resources, such as computation, database, file system, etc.
6.Once the task is carried out completely, the response is sent to the Event Loop that sends that response back to the client.

How is Node.js better than other frameworks most popularly used ?
-Node.js provides simplicity in development because of its non-blocking I/O and even-based model results in short response time and concurrent processing, unlike       other frameworks where developers have to use thread management.
-It runs on a chrome v8 engine which is written in c++ and is highly performant with constant improvement. 
-since we will use Javascript in both the frontend and backend the development will be much faster. 
-Better synchronization of code between server and client due to same code base
-And at last, there are ample libraries so that we don’t need to reinvent the wheel.
   
### Node.js Single-threaded
Node.js is single-threaded for async processing. By doing async processing on a single-thread under typical web loads, more performance and                              scalability can be achieved instead of the typical thread-based implementation.

### types of API functions are there in Node.js
There are two types of API functions
1.Asynchronous, non-blocking functions - mostly I/O operations which can be fork out of the main loop.
2.Synchronous, blocking functions - mostly operations that influence the process running in the main loop
  
### If Node.js is single-threaded, then how does it handle concurrency
The Multi-Threaded Request/Response Stateless Model is not followed by the Node JS Platform, and it adheres to the Single-Threaded Event Loop Model. The Node JS       Processing paradigm is heavily influenced by the JavaScript Event-based model and the JavaScript callback system. As a result, Node.js can easily manage more           concurrent client requests. The event loop is the processing model's beating heart in Node.js.

### NPM
NPM stands for Node Package Manager, responsible for managing all the packages and modules for Node.js
Provides online repositories for node.js packages/modules, which are searchable on search.nodejs.org
Provides command-line utility to install Node.js packages and also manages Node.js versions and dependencies

manage packages in your node.js project (Node Package Manager has over 50,000 bundles available at the developer’s disposal)
use npm or yarn. Both provide almost all libraries of javascript with extended features of controlling environment-specific configurations. To maintain versions of     libs being installed in a project we use package.json and package-lock.json so that there is no issue in porting that app to a different environment.

### modules in Node.js
Modules are like JavaScript libraries that can be used in a Node.js application to include a set of functions. To include a module in a Node.js     application, use the require() function with the parentheses containing the module's name.
Node.js has many modules to provide the basic functionality needed for a web application. 
-HTTP: Includes classes, methods, and events to create a Node.js HTTP server. and same as HTTPS but it is secure
-util: Includes utility functions useful for developers.
-fs: Includes events, classes, and methods to deal with file I/O operations.
-url: Includes methods for URL parsing
-query string: Includes methods to work with query string
-stream: Includes methods to handle streaming data
-zlib: Includes methods to compress or decompress files.

### purpose of the module.Exports
In Node.js, a module encapsulates all related codes into a single unit of code that can be parsed by moving all relevant functions into a single file. You may export a module with the module and export the function, which lets it be imported into another file with a needed keyword. 

### different types of HTTP requests
GET:- method is used to read (or retrieve) a representation of a resource. In case of success (or non-error), GET returns a representation in JSON and an HTTP response status code of 200 (OK). In an error case, it most often returns a 404 (NOT FOUND) or 400 (BAD REQUEST).

POST:- (POST is used to send data to a server, this data will be considered as new entry in the database)
method is most often utilized to create new resources. In particular, it is used to create subordinate resources. That is subordinate to some other (e.g. parent) resource. In other words, when creating a new resource, POST to the parent and the service takes care of associating the new resource with the parent, assigning an ID (new resource URI), etc.On successful creation, HTTP response code 201 is returned.

PUT:- creates a new resource or replaces a representation of the target resource with the request payload.

DELETE:-It is used to delete a resource identified by filters or ID. On successful deletion, the HTTP response status code 204 (No Content) returns with no response body.

### commonly used timing features of Node.js
setTimeout/clearTimeout – This is used to implement delays in code execution.
setInterval/clearInterval – This is used to run a code block multiple times.
setImmediate/clearImmediate – Any function passed as the setImmediate() argument is a callback that's executed in the next iteration of the event loop.
process.nextTick – Both setImmediate and process.nextTick appear to be doing the same thing; however, you may prefer one over the other depending on your             callback’s urgency.
    
### package.json file
The package.json file is the heart of a Node.js system. This file holds the metadata for a particular project. The package.json file is found in   the root directory of any Node application or module This is what a package.json file looks like immediately after creating a Node.js project using the command:     'npm init'
 
### Express
Express is a flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a wide set of features to develop both web and mobile applications
(creating server-side web applications faster and smarter. Simplicity, minimalism, flexibility, scalability are some of its characteristics )
The request object represents the HTTP request and has properties for the request query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers, and so on
The response object represents the HTTP response that an Express app sends when it receives an HTTP request
