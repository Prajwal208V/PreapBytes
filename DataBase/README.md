### What is Database
A database is an organized collection of data, stored and retrieved digitally from a remote or local computer system. Databases can be vast and complex, and such databases are developed using fixed design and modeling approaches

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is DBMS
DBMS stands for Database Management System. DBMS is a system software responsible for the creation, retrieval, updation, and management of the database. It ensures that our data is consistent, organized, and is easily accessible by serving as an interface between the database and its end-users or application software.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is Datawarehouse
Datawarehouse is a central repository of data from multiple sources of information. Those data are consolidated, transformed and made available for the mining and online processing. Warehouse data have a subset of data called Data Marts.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is RDBMS How is it different from DBMS
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. The key difference here, compared to DBMS, is that RDBMS stores data in the form of a collection of tables, and relations can be defined between the common fields of these tables. Most modern database management systems like MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, IBM DB2, and Amazon Redshift are based on RDBMS.

RDBMS: It is referred as Relation Database Management Systems (RDBMS). RDBMS possesses a set of the below given characteristics:

• Write-intensive operations: The RDBMS is frequently written to and is often used in transaction-oriented applications.

• Data in flux or historical data: The RDBMS is designed to handle frequently changing data. Alternatively, RDBMS can also store vast 
amounts of historical data, which can later be analyzed or "mined".

• Application-specific schema: The RDBMS is configured on a per-application basis and a unique schema exists to support each application.

• Complex data models. The relational nature of the RDBMS makes it suitable for handling sophisticated, complex data models that require many tables, foreign key values, complex join operations, and so on.

• Data integrity: The RDBMS features many components designed to ensure data integrity. This includes rollback operations, referential integrity, and transaction-oriented operations.


**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is SQL
SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is the standard language for relational database management systems. It is especially useful in handling organized data comprised of entities (variables) and relations between different entities of the data.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is PL SQL
PL/SQL Control Statements in Oracle.

Control Statements,

•	Control statements are very important in PL/SQL.

•	Control Statements are elements in a program that control the flow of program execution.

•	The syntax of control statements are similar to regular English and are very similar to choices that we make every day.

•	Branching statements are as follows:

o	If statement


o If - THEN - ELSE o Nested IF

o	Branching with logical connectivity

o	While

o	For Loop

### What is the difference between SQL and PL SQL
SQL: It is referred as Structured Query Language.

•	Only simple IF / Else statements.

•	Through SQL you can interact with database through ADO.NET

•	In SQL you can execute a line of code

•	It can run only on windows

PL/SQL: It is referred as Procedure Language / Structure Query Language:

•	In PL/SQL you can execute a block of code not a single line of code.

•	Deep control statements

•	It can run in UNIX also.

•	PL/SQL language includes object oriented programming techniques such as encapsulation, function overloading, and information hiding (all but inheritance).

### What is the difference between SQL and MySQL
SQL is a standard language for retrieving and manipulating structured databases. On the contrary, MySQL is a relational database management system, like SQL Server, Oracle or IBM DB2, that is used to manage SQL databases.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is a database table

Database table: Table contains records in the form of rows and columns. A permanent table is created in the database you specify and remains in the database permanently, until you delete it.

Syntax:

1.	Create table TableName (ID INT, NAME VARCHAR(30) )

2.	Drop syntax: drop table TableName

3.	Select Syntax: Select * from TableName


**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What are tables and Fields
A table is an organized collection of data stored in the form of rows and columns. Columns can be categorized as vertical and rows as horizontal. The columns in a table are called fields while the rows can be referred to as records.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is a query
A Database query is a code written in order to get the information back from the database. Query can be designed in such a way that it matched with our expectation of the result set. Simply, a question to the Database.
   
   ```sql
   SELECT fname, lname    /* select query */
   FROM myDb.students
   WHERE student_id = 1;
   
   
   UPDATE myDB.students    /* action query */
   SET fname = 'Captain', lname = 'America'
   WHERE student_id = 1;
   ```
  
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is subquery
A subquery is a query within another query. The outer query is called as main query, and inner query is called subquery. SubQuery is always executed first, and the result of subquery is passed on to the main query.

(A subquery is a query within another query, also known as a nested query or inner query. It is used to restrict or enhance the data to be queried by the main query, thus restricting or enhancing the output of the main query respectively. For example, here we fetch the contact information for students who have enrolled for the maths subject)

   ```sql
   SELECT name, email, mob, address
  FROM myDb.contacts
  WHERE roll_no IN (
  SELECT roll_no
  FROM myDb.students
  WHERE subject = 'Maths'); 
  ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What are the types of subquery
There are two types of subquery - Correlated and Non-Correlated.
 • A correlated subquery cannot be considered as an independent query, but it can refer to the column in a table listed in the FROM of the main query.
 • A non-correlated subquery can be considered as an independent query and the output of the subquery is substituted in the main query.
    
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is a database relationship
Relationships are created by linking the column in one table with the column in another table. There are four different types of relationship that can be created.

***different types of relationships in SQL

• One-to-One - This can be defined as the relationship between two tables where each record in one table is associated with the maximum of one record in the other table.
• One-to-Many & Many-to-One - This is the most commonly used relationship where a record in a table is associated with multiple records in the other table.
• Many-to-Many - This is used in cases when multiple instances on both sides are needed for defining a relationship.
• Self-Referencing Relationships - This is used when a table needs to define a relationship with itself

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Crud Operations in SQL
CRUD is an abbreviation for Create, Read, Update and Delete. These 4 operations comprise the most basic database operations. The relevant commands for these 4
operations in SQL are:

• Create: INSERT, To insert any new data into a database
• Read: SELECT, We use the select statement to perform the Read ( R ) operation of CRUD.
• Update: UPDATE, used to update the contents of specific columns of specific rows.
• Delete: DELETE,  used to delete or remove some rows from a table.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### How to create a table in SQL
SQL provides an organized way for table creation.

Syntax:  
  ```sql
  Create table TableName (
    columnName1 datatype 
    columnName2 datatype 
   )
  ```
  
  ```sql
  create table Info (
    Name varchar(20)
    BirthDate date
    Phone varchar(12)
    City varchar(20)
  )
  ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### How to update a database table using SQL
To update an existing Table we use SQL Command UPDATE: It will update the records as per user defined query/need.

Syntax:

   ```sql
   Update TableName 
   SET ColumnName = NewData 
   where Condition
   ```
   ```sql
   Update info
   Set City = 'Baroda'
   where id = 2
   ```

### How to delete a table in SQL Server
Delete Data Record from Database Table and deleting an existing table by the following method:

Syntax:To delete all table records of a table:
   ```sql
   Delete TableName  // To delete all table records of a table
   
	 Delete TableName  // To delete particular row/column in table
   WHERE condition  
   ```
   
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM info
   WHERE City = "Scaler";
   ```

### What are the TRUNCATE, DELETE and DROP statements
DELETE statement is used to delete rows from a table.
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM Candidates
   WHERE CandidateId > 1000;
   ```
   
TRUNCATE command is used to delete all the rows from the table and free the space containing the table.
  ```sql
  TRUNCATE TABLE Candidates;
  ```
  
DROP command is used to remove an object from the database. If you drop a table, all the rows in the table are deleted and the table structure is removed from the database.
  ```sql
  DROP TABLE Candidates;
  ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is the difference between DELETE TABLE and TRUNCATE TABLE commands
The TRUNCATE command is used to delete all the rows from the table and free the space containing the table.
The DELETE command deletes only the rows from the table based on the condition given in the where clause or deletes all the rows from the table if no condition is specified. But it does not free the space containing the table.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is the difference between DROP and TRUNCATE statements
If a table is dropped, all things associated with the tables are dropped as well. This includes - the relationships defined on the table with other tables, the integrity checks and constraints, access privileges and other grants that the table has. To create and use the table again in its original form, all these relations, checks, constraints, privileges and relationships need to be redefined. However, if a table is truncated, none of the above problems exist and the table retains its original structure.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### When are we going to use truncate and delete

1.	TRUNCATE is a DDL command, whereas DELETE is a DML command.

2.	We can’t execute a trigger in case of TRUNCATE whilst with DELETE, we can accomplish a trigger.

3.	TRUNCATE is quicker than DELETE, for the reason that when we use DELETE to delete the data, at that time it store the whole 
statistics in the rollback gap on or after where we can get the data back after removal. In case of TRUNCATE, it will not store data in rollback gap and will unswervingly rub it out. TRUNCATE do not recover the deleted data.

4.	We can use any condition in WHERE clause using DELETE but it is not possible with TRUNCATE.5.If a table is referenced by any foreign key constraints, then TRUNCATE won’t work.

### SQL Commands
SQL Commands are instructions that are used by the user to communicate with the database, to perform specific tasks, functions and queries of data
Types of SQL Commands:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92531202/167480510-697ba51c-64a2-4f6b-8633-b46944d70c6a.png)

### Data Definition Language
1. Data Definition Language(DDL): It changes a table’s structure by adding, deleting and altering its contents. Its changes are auto-committed(all changes are automatically permanently saved in the database). Some commands that are a part of DDL are:

CREATE: Used to create a new table in the database.

	```sql
	CREATE TABLE STUDENT(Name VARCHAR2(20), Email VARCHAR2(100), DOB DATE);
	```
	
ALTER: Used to alter contents of a table by adding some new column or attribute, or changing some existing attribute.

	```sql
	ALTER TABLE STUDENT ADD(ADDRESS VARCHAR2(20));
	ALTER TABLE STUDENT MODIFY (ADDRESS VARCHAR2(20));
	```

DROP: Used to delete the structure and record stored in the table
	
	```sql
	DROP TABLE STUDENT;
	```

TRUNCATE: Used to delete all the rows from the table, and free up the space inthe table.

	```sql
	TRUNCATE TABLE STUDENT;
	```
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Data Manipulation Language

2. Data Manipulation Language(DML): It is used for modifying a database, and is responsible for any form of change in a database. These commands are not autocommitted, i.e all changes are not automatically saved in the database. Some
commands that are a part of DML are:
  
  INSERT: Used to insert data in the row of a table
  
	```sql
	INSERT INTO STUDENT (Name, Subject) VALUES ("Scaler", "DSA");
	```
  UPDATE: Used to update value of a table’s column.
 	
	```sql
	UPDATE STUDENT
	SET User_Name = 'Interviewbit'
	WHERE Student_Id = '2'
	```
  DELETE: Used to delete one or more rows in a table.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Data Control Language

3. Data Control Language(DCL): These commands are used to grant and take back access/authority (revoke) from any database user. Some commands that are a part of
DCL are:
    Grant: Used to grant a user access privileges to a database.
    
   ```sql
    GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON TABLE_1 TO USER_1, USER_2;
   ```
   
   Revoke: Used to revoke the permissions from an user.
   
   ```sql
    REVOKE SELECT, UPDATE ON TABLE_1 FROM USER_1, USER_2;
   ```
  https://github.com/Prajwal208V/PreapBytes/blob/master/DataBase/SQL%20cheat%20sheet%20.pdf

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Transaction Control Language
Transaction Control Language: These commands can be used only with DML commands in conjunction and belong to the category of auto-committed
commands. Some commands that are a part of TCL are:
  COMMIT: Saves all the transactions made on a database.
	
	```sql
	DELETE FROM STUDENTS
	WHERE AGE = 16;
	COMMIT;
	```
  ROLLBACK: It is used to undo transactions which are not yet been saved.	
	
	```sql
	DELETE FROM STUDENTS
	WHERE AGE = 16;
	ROLLBACK;
	```
  SAVEPOINT: Used to roll transaction back to a certain point without having to roll back the entirity of the transaction.	
  
       	```sql
	SAVEPOINT SAVED;
	DELETE FROM STUDENTS
	WHERE AGE = 16;
	ROLLBACK TO SAVED;
	```
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

5.Data Query Language: It is used to fetch some data from a database. 

The command belonging to this category is:       
   SELECT: It is used to retrieve selected data based on some conditions which are described using the WHERE clause. It is to be noted that the WHERE clause is
   also optional to be used here and can be used depending on the user’s needs.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What are Constraints in SQL
Constraints are rules which are applied on a table. For example, specifying valid limits or ranges on data in the table etc.
The valid constraints in SQL are:
1. NOT NULL: Specifies that this column cannot store a NULL value

	```sql
	CREATE TABLE Student
	(
	ID int(8) NOT NULL,
	NAME varchar(30) NOT NULL,
	ADDRESS varchar(50)
	);
	```
In the above example, we create a table STUDENT, which has some attributes it has to store. Among these attributes we declare that the columns ID and NAME cannot
have NULL values in their fields using NOT NULL constraint.

2. UNIQUE: Specifies that this column can have only Unique values, i.e the values cannot be repeated in the column.

	```sql
	CREATE TABLE Student
	(
	ID int(8) UNIQUE,
	NAME varchar(10) NOT NULL,
	ADDRESS varchar(20)
	);
	```

In the above example, we create a table Student and declare the ID column to be unique using the UNIQUE constraint.

3. Primary Key: It is a field using which it is possible to uniquely identify each row in a table. We will get to know about this in detail in the upcoming section.
4. Foreign Key: It is a field using which it is possible to uniquely identify each row in some other table. We will get to know about this in detail in the upcoming section.
5. CHECK: It validates if all values in a column satisfy some particular condition or not.
6. 
	```sql
	CREATE TABLE Student
	(
	ID int(6) NOT NULL,
	NAME varchar(10),
	AGE int CHECK (AGE < 20)
	)
	```
Here, in the above query, we add the CHECK constraint into the table. By adding the constraint, we can only insert entries that satisfy the condition AGE < 20 into the
table.

6. DEFAULT: It specifies a default value for a column when no value is specified for that field.

	```sql
	CREATE TABLE Student
	(
	ID int(8) NOT NULL,
	NAME varchar(50) NOT NULL,
	CLASS int DEFAULT 2
	);
	```
	
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Types of Keys

A database consists of multiple tables and these tables and their contents are related to each other by some relations/conditions. To identify each row of these tables
uniquely, we make use of SQL keys. A SQL key can be a single column or a group of columns used to uniquely identify the rows of a table. SQL keys are a means to ensure that no row will have duplicate values. They are also a means to establish relations between multiple tables in a database

Types of Keys:

1. Primary Key: They uniquely identify a row in a table.
Properties:
• Only a single primary key for a table. (A special case is a composite key, which can be formed by the composition of 2 or more columns, and act as a single
candidate key.)

• The primary key column cannot have any NULL values.

• The primary key must be unique for each row.

Example:

	```sql
	CREATE TABLE Student (
	  ID int NOT NULL,
	  LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
	  FirstName varchar(255),
	  Class int,
	  PRIMARY KEY (ID)
	);
	```
The above example creates a table called STUDENT with some given properties(columns) and assigns the ID column as the primary key of the table. Using
the value of ID column, we can uniquely identify its corresponding row.

2. Foreign Key: Foreign keys are keys that reference the primary keys of some other table. They establish a relationship between 2 tables and link them up.

Example: In the below example, a table called Orders is created with some given attributes and its Primary Key is declared to be OrderID and Foreign Key is declared
to be PersonId referenced from the Person's table. A person's table is assumed to be created beforehand.

	```sql
	CREATE TABLE Orders (
	  OrderID int NOT NULL,
	  OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
	  PersonID int,
	  PRIMARY KEY (OrderID),
	  FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)
	);
	```
	
3.Super Key: It is a group of single or multiple keys which identifies row of a table.

4.Candidate Key: It is a collection of unique attributes that can uniquely identify tuples in a table.

5.Alternate Key: It is a column or group of columns that can identify every row in a table uniquely.

6.Compound Key: It is a collection of more than one record that can be used to uniquely identify a specific record.

7.Composite Key: Collection of more than one column that can uniquely identify rows in a table.

8.Surrogate Key: It is an artificial key that aims to uniquely identify each record.

Amongst these, the Primary and Foreign keys are most commonly used.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is the difference between Primary key and unique key

Primary key does not allow the null values but unique key allows one null value.

Primary key will create clustered index on column but unique key will create non-clustered index by default.

### What is database normalization

Database normalization is the process of organizing the fields and tables of a relational database to minimize redundancy and dependency. Normalization usually involves dividing large tables into smaller (and less redundant) tables and defining relationships among them. Normalization is a bottom-up technique for database design.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What are the various forms of Normalization

Normalization is the process of organizing data into a related table. it also eliminates redundancy and increases the integrity which improves performance of the query. To normalize a database, we divide the database into tables and establish relationships between the tables

•	First Normal Form (1NF)

•	Second Normal Form (2NF)

•	Third Normal Form (3NF)

•	Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)

•	4th Normal Form

•	5th Normal Form

•	6th Normal Form

1)First Normal Form (1NF):

This should remove all the duplicate columns from the table. Creation of tables for the related data and identification of unique columns.
								|or|
(A relation is in first normal form if every attribute in that relation is a single-valued attribute. If a relation contains a composite or multi-valued attribute, it violates the first normal form. Let's consider the example students table. Each student in the table, has a name, his/her address, and the books they issued from the public library -

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92531202/167578323-a21b0773-f37b-4c62-b830-951c0370da05.png)


the Books Issued field has more than one value per record, and to convert it into 1NF, this has to be resolved into separate individual records for each book issued.  the following table in 1NF form -

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92531202/167578021-4244b59e-b00a-441d-ad18-42c8eab36636.png)

2)Second Normal Form (2NF):

Meeting all requirements of the first normal form. Placing the subsets of data in separate tables and Creation of relationships between the tables using primary keys.

(A relation is in second normal form if it satisfies the conditions for the first normal form and does not contain any partial dependency. A relation in 2NF has no partial dependency, i.e., it has no non-prime attribute that depends on any proper subset of any candidate key of the table. Often, specifying a single column Primary Key is the solution to the problem.)

Example1 -
the Students Table in the 1NF form has a candidate key in the form of [Student, Address] that can uniquely identify all records in the table. The field Books Issued (non-prime attribute) depends partially on the Student field. Hence, the table is not in 2NF. To convert it into the 2nd Normal Form, we will partition the tables into two while specifying a new Primary Key attribute to identify the individual records in the Students table. The Foreign Key constraint will be set on the other table to ensure referential integrity.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92531202/167579622-597d2b16-139a-4c09-b7c0-379ca29874b0.png)

Example 2 - Consider the following dependencies in relation to R(W,X,Y,Z)

 WX -> Y    [W and X together determine Y] 
 XY -> Z    [X and Y together determine Z] 
 
Here, WX is the only candidate key and there is no partial dependency, i.e., any proper subset of WX doesn’t determine any non-prime attribute in the relation.

3) Third  Normal Form (2NF):

This should meet all requirements of 2NF. Removing the columns which are not dependent on primary key constraints.

(A relation is said to be in the third normal form, if it satisfies the conditions for the second normal form and there is no transitive dependency between the non-prime attributes, i.e., all non-prime attributes are determined only by the candidate keys of the relation and not by any other non-prime attribute.)

Example 1 - the Students Table in the 2NF form has a single candidate key Student_ID (primary key) that can uniquely identify all records in the table. The field Salutation (non-prime attribute), however, depends on the Student Field rather than the candidate key. Hence, the table is not in 3NF. To convert it into the 3rd Normal Form, we will once again partition the tables into two while specifying a new Foreign Key constraint to identify the salutations for individual records in the Students table. The Primary Key constraint for the same will be set on the Salutations table to identify each record uniquely.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92531202/167581495-b12cd2c6-309f-4da7-b7d2-e554d94f1bfe.png)

Example 2 - Consider the following dependencies in relation to R(P,Q,R,S,T)

 P -> QR     [P together determine C] 
 RS -> T     [B and C together determine D] 
 Q -> S 
 T -> P 
For the above relation to exist in 3NF, all possible candidate keys in the above relation should be {P, RS, QR, T}.

Boyce-Codd Normal Form
A relation is in Boyce-Codd Normal Form if satisfies the conditions for third normal form and for every functional dependency, Left-Hand-Side is super key. In other words, a relation in BCNF has non-trivial functional dependencies in form X –> Y, such that X is always a super key. For example - In the above example, Student_ID serves as the sole unique identifier for the Students Table and Salutation_ID for the Salutations Table, thus these tables exist in BCNF. The same cannot be said for the Books Table and there can be several books with common Book Names and the same Student_ID

4)Fourth Normal Form (4NF):
Meeting all the requirements of third normal form and it should not have multi- valued dependencies.

### What is Denormalization

DeNormalization is a technique used to access the data from higher to lower normal forms of database. It is also process of introducing redundancy into a table by incorporating data from the related tables. 

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Clauses in SQL
Clauses are in-built functions available in SQL and are used for filtering and analysing data quickly allowing the user to efficiently extract the required information from the database.

Example – Query that has WHERE condition

Query that has HAVING condition.

The below table lists some of the important SQL clauses and their description with
examples:

### SQL Operators in-built functions 
Operators are used in SQL to form complex expressions which can be evaluated to code more intricate queries and extract more precise data from a database.
There are 3 main types of operators: Arithmetic, Comparision and Logical operators.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92531202/167585115-604be169-8b5d-48f1-9221-8a26c81eaf56.png)

• Arithmetic Operators: Arithmetic Operators allows the user to perform arithmetic operations in SQL.

• Relational Operators: Relational operators are used to performing relational expressions in SQL, i.e those expressions whose value either result in true or false.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92531202/167585686-db14ebc4-f70b-4b39-ba88-2dd923374774.png)

• Compound Operators: Compound operators are basically a combination of 2 or more arithmetic or relational operator, which can be used as a shorthand while writing code.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92531202/167585837-f139a8f4-68e3-438b-b0cf-51f3661fef86.png)

• Logical Operators: Logical operators are used to combining 2 or more relational statements into 1 compound statement whose truth value is evaluated as a whole.

### Joins in SQL

Joins are a SQL concept that allows us to fetch data aer combining multiple tables of a database
(If you want to retrieve data from multiple tables then you need to use joins in SQL Server. Joins are used to get data from two or more tables based on the relationships among some of the columns in the tables.)

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What are different types of joins in SQL Server

Joins are useful for bringing data together from different tables based on their database relations. First we will see how the join operates between tables. Then we will explore the Order of Execution when both a join and a where condition exist. Finally we will move our exploration to the importance of the Join order.

A Join condition defines a way two tables are related in a query by:

•	Specifying the column to be used for the Join from each table. In joining foreign keys in a table and its associated key in the  other table.

•	To use the logical operator in comparing values from the columns.

There are four type of joins available based on the way we join columns of two different tables.

1.	Full Join

2.	Inner Join

3.	Left outer Join

4.	Right outer Join



![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92531202/167593524-64da0f11-b2e8-4678-a8da-909dd4487d71.png)

• Inner Join: rieves records that have matching values in both tables involved in the join. This is the widely used join for queries.

	```sql
	SELECT *
	FROM Table_A
	JOIN Table_B;
	SELECT *
	FROM Table_A
	INNER JOIN Table_B;
	```
Example:
	
	```sql
	SELECT orders.order_id, products.product_name,customers.customer_name,products.price
	FROM orders
	INNER JOIN products ON products.product_id = order.product_id
	INNER JOIN customers on customers.customer_id = order.customer_id;
	```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92531202/167598328-4974b0f6-d4e2-4263-a943-a1c5256e02dc.png)

using Inner Joins:

• RIGHT JOIN:  Retrieves all the records/rows from the right and the matched records/rows from the left table.

	```sql
	SELECT *
	FROM Table_A A
	RIGHT JOIN Table_B B
	ON A.col = B.col;
	```
	
Example: Returns all of the records from the second table, along with any matching records from the first.

	```sql
	SELECT Orders.OrderID, Employees.LastName, Employees.FirstName
	FROM Orders
	RIGHT JOIN Employees
	ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
	ORDER BY Orders.OrderID;
	```
	
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92531202/167599541-5cc682bc-630e-4c18-bf9e-b9ef1e92baa3.png)

• LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Retrieves all the records/rows from the left and the matched records/rows from the right table.
	
	```sql
	SELECT *
	FROM Table_A A
	LEFT JOIN Table_B B
	ON A.col = B.col;
	```

Example: Returns all of the records from the first table, along with any matching records from the second table.

	```sql
	SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
	FROM Customers
	LEFT JOIN Orders
	ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
	ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;
	```
	
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92531202/167600471-3083cbcb-34da-4bd5-805a-41f7d25fc0eb.png)

• FULL JOIN: Retrieves all the records where there is a match in either the left or right table.

	```sql
	SELECT *
	FROM Table_A A
	FULL JOIN Table_B B
	ON A.col = B.col;
	```

Example	: Returns all records from both tables when there is a match.

	```sql
	SELECT ID, NAME, AMOUNT, DATE
	FROM CUSTOMERS
	FULL JOIN ORDERS
	ON CUSTOMERS.ID = ORDERS.CUSTOMER_ID;
	```

We will get the following table as the result of the outer join.

### Self Join

A self JOIN is a case of regular join where a table is joined to itself based on some relation between its own column(s). Self-join uses the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN clause and a table alias is used to assign different names to the table within the query.

	``sql
	SELECT A.emp_id AS "Emp_ID",A.emp_name AS "Employee",
	B.emp_id AS "Sup_ID",B.emp_name AS "Supervisor"
	FROM employee A, employee B
	WHERE A.emp_sup = B.emp_id;
	```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Cross Join

Cross join can be defined as a cartesian product of the two tables included in the join. The table after join contains the same number of rows as in the cross-product of the number of rows in the two tables. If a WHERE clause is used in cross join then the query will work like an INNER JOIN.

	```sql
	SELECT stu.name, sub.subject 
	FROM students AS stu
	CROSS JOIN subjects AS sub;
	```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92531202/167604461-3f3908c2-dd7e-43c8-a855-492ae4c23346.png)

### What is a stored procedure

A Stored Procedure is a collection or a group of T-SQL statements. Stored Procedures are a precompiled set of one or more statements that are stored together in the database. They reduce the network load because of the precompilation. We can create a Stored Procedure using the "Create proc" statement.
(SQL procedures are stored in SQL codes, which can be saved for reuse again and again.)

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Why we use Stored Procedure

There are several reasons to use a Stored Procedure. They are a network load reducer and decrease execution time because they are precompiled. The most important use of a Stored Procedure is for security purposes. They can restrict SQL Injection. We can avoid SQL injection by use of a Stored Procedure.

Advantages of using a Stored Procedure in SQL Server

•	It is very easy to maintain a Stored Procedure and they are re-usable.

•	The Stored Procedure retains the state of the execution plans.

•	Stored Procedures can be encrypted and that also prevents SQL Injection Attacks

### What is a stored procedure

A stored procedure that calls itself until a boundary condition is reached, is called a recursive stored procedure. This recursive function helps the programmers to deploy the same set of code several times as and when required. Some SQL programming languages limit the recursion depth to prevent an infinite loop of procedure calls from causing a stack overflow, which slows down the system and may lead to system crashes.

	```sql
	DELIMITER $$     /* Set a new delimiter => $$ */
	CREATE PROCEDURE calctotal( /* Create the procedure */
	   IN number INT,   /* Set Input and Ouput variables */
	   OUT total INT
	) BEGIN
	DECLARE score INT DEFAULT NULL;   /* Set the default value => "score" */
	SELECT awards FROM achievements   /* Update "score" via SELECT query */
	WHERE id = number INTO score;
	IF score IS NULL THEN SET total = 0;   /* Termination condition */
	ELSE
	CALL calctotal(number+1);   /* Recursive call */
	SET total = total + score;   /* Action after recursion */
	END IF;
	END $$     /* End of procedure */
	DELIMITER ;     /* Reset the delimiter */
	```

### Triggers in SQL
SQL codes automatically executed in response to a certain event occurring in a table of a database are called triggers. There cannot be more than 1 trigger with a similar action time and event for one table.

"A Trigger is a Database object just like a stored procedure or we can say it is a special kind of Stored Procedure which fires when an event occurs in a database."
It is a database object that is bound to a table and is executed automatically. We cannot explicitly call any trigger. Triggers provide data integrity and used to access and check data before and after modification using DDL or DML query.

There are two types of Triggers:

1.	DDL Trigger

2.	DML trigger

DDL Triggers: They fire in response to DDL (Data Definition Language) command events that start with Create, Alter and Drop like Create_table, Create_view, drop_table, Drop_view and Alter_table.

Code of DDL Triggers:

create trigger saftey on database for

create_table, alter_table, drop_table
as   print 'you can not create ,drop and alter table in this database'    rollback;

DML Triggers: They fire in response to DML (Data Manipulation Language) command events that start with Insert, Update and Delete like insert_table, Update_view and Delete_table.

Code of DML Trigger:

create trigger deep on emp  for insert, update, delete 	as	print 'you can notinsert,update and delete this table I' 	rollback;

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

###  Why do we need triggers

We use a trigger when we want some event to happen automatically on certain desirable scenarios.
You have a table that changes frequently, now you want to know how many times and when these changes take place. In that case you can create a trigger that will insert the desired data into another table whenever any change in the main table occurs.

In SQL Server we can create the following 3 types of triggers:

•	Data Definition Language (DDL) triggers

•	Data Manipulation Language (DML) triggers

•	Logon triggers

Example:

	```sql
	CREATE TRIGGER trgAfterInsert ON[dbo].[Employee_Test]
	FOR INSERT AS
	declare@ empid int; declare@ empname varchar(100);
	declare@ empsal decimal(10, 2);
	declare@ audit_action varchar(100);
	select@ empid = i.Emp_ID from inserted i;
	select@ empname = i.Emp_Name from inserted i;
	select@ empsal = i.Emp_Sal from inserted i; 
	set@ audit_action = 'Inserted Record -- After Insert Trigger.'; 	
	insert into Employee_Test_Audit	(Emp_ID, Emp_Name, Emp_Sal, Audit_Action, Audit_Timestamp)	values(@empid, @empname, @empsal, @audit_action, getdate()); 
	PRINT 'AFTER INSERT trigger fired.' 	
	GO
	```

### What are the different types of triggers

Triggers are a special type of stored procedure which is executed automatically based on the occurrence of a database event. These events can be categorized as:

•	Data Manipulation Language (DML) and

•	Data Definition Language (DDL) events.

The benefit derived from triggers is based in their events driven nature. Once created, the trigger automatically fires without user intervention based on an event in the database.

A. Using DML Triggers: DML triggers are invoked when any DML command such as INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE occurs on the data of a table and/or view.

• DML triggers are powerful objects for maintaining database integrity and consistency.

• DML triggers evaluate data before it has been committed to the database. o During this evaluation the following actions are performed.

We cannot use the following commands in DML trigger:

o	ALTER DATABASE

o	CREATE DATABASE

o	DISK DATABASE

o	LOAD DATABASE

o	RESTORE DATABASE

B.	Using DDL Triggers:

• These triggers focus on changes to the definition of database objects as opposed to changes to the actual data.

• This type of trigger is useful for controlling development and production database environments.

Let us create DDL trigger now-

The following is the syntax.

	```sql
	CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name	ON{ALL SERVER | DATABASE	}

	[WITH < ddl_trigger_option > [, ...n]]{	FOR | AFTER	}	{

	event_type | event_group	}[, ...n]	AS

	{sql_statement[;][...n] | EXTERNAL NAME < method specifier > [;] 	}
	```
	
	```sql
	CREATE TRIGGER tr_TableAudit	ON DATABASE FOR CREATE_TABLE, ALTER_TABLE, DROP_TABLE AS PRINT 'You must disable the TableAudit trigger 
	in order to change any table in this database ' 	ROLLBACK 	GO
 	```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### if we have multiple AFTER Triggers on table how can we define the sequence od the triggers

If a table has multiple AFTER triggers, then you can specify which trigger should be executed first and which trigger should be executed last using the stored procedure sp_settriggerorder.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is a view in the database
A view in SQL is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92531202/167674934-4d4ccced-ddb3-4f1f-8cdf-891a39ad99cd.png)

A View is nothing but a select query with a name given to it or we can simply say a view is a Named Query.

need a view:
 
• A view can combine data from multiple tables using adequate joins and while bringing it may require complex filters and calculated data to form the required result set. From a user's point of view, all these complexities are hidden data queried from a single table.

• Sometimes for security purposes, access to the table, table structures and table relationships are not given to the database user. All they have is access to a view not knowing what tables actually exist in the database.

• Using the view, you can restrict the user update only portions of the records.

• To control access to rows and columns of data.

• To aggregate data for performance.

• To hide the complexity of the underlying database schema, or customize the data and schema for a set of users.

Views are used for security purposes because they provide encapsulation of the name of the table. Data is in the virtual table, not stored permanently. Views display only selected data.


The following are the key points to be noted about views:

1.	Multiple views can be created on one table.

2.	Views can be defined as read-only or updatable.

3.	Views can be indexed for better performance.

4.	Insert, update, delete can be done on an updatable view.

There are two types of views.

•	Simple View

•	Complex View

Syntax of a View:

	```sql
	CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name 
	WHERE condition 
	```

### SQL Injection

Insertion or ‘Injection’ of some SQL Query from the input data of the client to the application is called SQL Injection. They can perform CRUD operations on the
database and can read to vulnerabilities and loss of data.

It can occur in 2 ways:
Data is used to dynamically construct an SQL Query.
Unintended data from an untrusted source enters the application.

The consequences of SQL Injections can be Confidentiality issues, Authentication breaches, Authorization vulnerabilities, and breaking the Integrity of the system.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92531202/167678683-165737d3-d296-4b13-a9ef-53006938ed9d.png)

The above image shows an example of SQL injections, through the use of 2 tables-students and library.

Here the hacker is injecting SQL code -

	```sql
	UNION SELECT studentName, rollNo FROM students
	```
	
into the Database server, where his query is used to JOIN the tables - students and library. Joining the 2 tables, the result of the query is returned from the database, using which the hacker gains access to the information he needs thereby taking advantage of the system vulnerability. The arrows in the diagram show the flow of how the SQL Injection causes the vulnerability in the database system, starting from the hacker’s computer.

OR

"It is a Form of attack on a database-driven Web site in which the attacker executes unauthorized SQL commands by taking advantage of insecure code on a system connected to the Internet, bypassing the firewall. SQL injection attacks are used to steal information from a database from which the data would normally not be available and/or to gain access to an organization’s host computers through the computer that is hosting the database.

SQL injection attacks typically are easy to avoid by ensuring that a system has strong input validation.

As name suggest we inject SQL which can be relatively dangerous for the database. Example this is a simple SQL 

SELECT email, passwd, login_id, full_name FROM members WHERE email = 'x'

Now somebody does not put “x” as the input but puts “x ; DROP TABLE members;”. So the actual SQL which will execute is:- 

SELECT email, passwd, login_id, full_name FROM members WHERE email = ‘x’; DROP TABLE members;

Think what will happen to your database."

### What is an Index Explain its different types

An Index is one of the most powerful techniques to work with this enormous information. Database tables are not enough for getting the data efficiently in case of a huge amount of data. In order to get the data quickly we need to index the column in a table.

An index is a database object that is created and maintained by the DBMS. Indexed columns are ordered or sorted so that data searching is extremely fast. An index can be applied on a column or a view. A table can have more than one index.

There are different types of indexes that can be created for different purposes:

1.Unique and Non-Unique Index:
• Unique indexes are indexes that help maintain data integrity by ensuring that no two rows of data in a table have identical key values. Once a unique index has been defined for a table, uniqueness is enforced whenever keys are added or changed within the index.

	```sql
	CREATE UNIQUE INDEX myIndex
	ON students (enroll_no);
	```
• Non-unique indexes, on the other hand, are not used to enforce constraints on the tables with which they are associated. Instead, non-unique indexes are used solely to improve query performance by maintaining a sorted order of data values that are used frequently. 

2.Clustered and Non-Clustered Index:

• Clustered Index: A Clustered Index sorts and stores the data in the table based on keys. A Clustered Index can be defined only once per 
table in the SQL Server Database, because the data rows can be sorted in only one order. Text, nText and Image data are not allowed as a Clustered index.

	```sql
	SET STATISTICS IO ON
	SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE EmpID = 20001
	EmpID	EmpName	Cell	Dept 20001	Black Smith	12345678901	1
        ```
	
• Non-Clustered Index: Non Clustered Indexes or simply indexes are created outside of the table. SQL Server supports 999 Non-Clustered per table and each Non-Clustered can have up to 1023 columns. A Non-Clustered Index does not support the Text, nText and Image data types.

	```sql
	CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX NCL_ID ON Employee(DeptID)
        SET STATISTICS IO ON
	SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE DeptID = 20001
	EmpID	EmpName	Cell	Dept
	40001	Black Smith	12345678901	20001
	```
The only difference between clustered and non-clustered indexes is that the database manager attempts to keep the data in the database in the same order as the corresponding keys appear in the clustered index.

Clustering indexes can improve the performance of most query operations because they provide a linear-access path to data stored in the database.

### Why do I need an index in a database

An Index is a database object that can be created on one or more columns (16 max column combinations). When creating the index it will read the column(s) and forms a relevant data structure to minimize the number of data comparisons. The index will improve the performance of data retrieval and add some overhead to the data modification such as create, delete and modify. So it depends on how much data retrieval can be done on table versus how much of DML (Insert, Delete and Update) operations.

Need of Index in Database: An index is basically used for fast data retrieval from the database.

Syntax: 

	```sql
	CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name;
	```
	or
	
	```sql
	DROP INDEX index_name;
	```

### Clustered and Non-Clustered Index

• Clustered index modifies the way records are stored in a database based on the indexed column. A non-clustered index creates a separate entity within the table which references the original table.

• Clustered index is used for easy and speedy retrieval of data from the database, whereas, fetching records from the non-clustered index is relatively slower.

•  In SQL, a table can have a single clustered index whereas it can have multiple non-clustered indexes

### What is OLTP Online Transaction Processing

OLTP stands for Online Transaction Processing, is a class of software applications capable of supporting transaction-oriented programs. An essential attribute of an OLTP system is its ability to maintain concurrency. To avoid single points of failure, OLTP systems are often decentralized. These systems are usually designed for a large number of users who conduct short transactions. Database queries are usually simple, require sub-second response times, and return relatively few records. Here is an insight into the working of an OLTP system 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92531202/167683226-0b32e21c-6a67-4309-a91e-a58e37846b38.png)

### What are the differences between OLTP and OLAP

OLTP stands for Online Transaction Processing, is a class of software applications capable of supporting transaction-oriented programs. An important attribute of an OLTP system is its ability to maintain concurrency. OLTP systems often follow a decentralized architecture to avoid single points of failure. These systems are generally designed for a large audience of end-users who conduct short transactions. Queries involved in such databases are generally simple, need fast response times, and return relatively few records. A number of transactions per second acts as an effective measure for such systems.

OLAP stands for Online Analytical Processing, a class of software programs that are characterized by the relatively low frequency of online transactions. Queries are often too complex and involve a bunch of aggregations. For OLAP systems, the effectiveness measure relies highly on response time. Such systems are widely used for data mining or maintaining aggregated, historical data, usually in multi-dimensional schemas.

### What is the use of OLAP?  ❌

OLAP is useful because it provides fast and interactive access to aggregated data and the ability to drill down to detail.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is a measure in OLAP? ❌

Measures are the key performance indicator that you want to evaluate. To determine which of the numbers in the data might be measures. A rule of thumb is if a number makes sense when it is aggregated, then it is a measure.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What are dimensions in OLAP? ❌

Dimensions are the categories of data analysis. For example, in a revenue report by month by sales region, the two dimensions needed are time and sales region. Typical dimensions include product, time, and region.

### What are Entities and Relationships

Entity: An entity can be a real-world object, either tangible or intangible, that can be easily identifiable. For example, in a college database, students, professors, workers, departments, and projects can be referred to as entities. Each entity has some associated properties that provide it an identity.

Relationships: Relations or links between entities that have something to do with each other. For example - The employee's table in a company's database can be associated with the salary table in the same database.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92531202/167683954-861b8f15-b41a-490d-9ef3-0d0f9b16399a.png)

List the different types of relationships in SQL:

• One-to-One - This can be defined as the relationship between two tables where each record in one table is associated with the maximum of one record in the other table.

• One-to-Many & Many-to-One - This is the most commonly used relationship where a record in a table is associated with multiple records in the other table.

• Many-to-Many - This is used in cases when multiple instances on both sides are needed for defining a relationship.

• Self-Referencing Relationships - This is used when a table needs to define a relationship with itself.

### What is an Alias in SQL

It is a temporary name assigned to the table or table column for the purpose of a particular SQL query. In addition, aliasing can be employed as an obfuscation technique to secure the real names of database fields. A table alias is also called a correlation name.

An alias is represented explicitly by the AS keyword but in some cases, the same can be performed without it as well. Nevertheless, using the AS keyword is always a good practice.

	```sql
	SELECT A.emp_name AS "Employee"  /* Alias using AS keyword */
	B.emp_name AS "Supervisor"
	FROM employee A, employee B   /* Alias without AS keyword */
	WHERE A.emp_sup = B.emp_id;
	```

### What is Data Integrity

Data Integrity defines the accuracy and consistency of data stored in a database. It can also define integrity constraints to enforce business rules on the data when it is entered into the application or database.

OR

Data Integrity is the assurance of accuracy and consistency of data over its entire life-cycle and is a critical aspect of the design, implementation, and usage of any system which stores, processes, or retrieves data. It also defines integrity constraints to enforce business rules on the data when it is entered into an application or a database.

### ### What is Auto Increment ❌

Auto increment keyword allows the user to create a unique number to be generated when a new record is inserted into the table. AUTO INCREMENT keyword can be used in Oracle and IDENTITY keyword can be used in SQL SERVER.
Mostly this keyword can be used whenever PRIMARY KEY is used.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What are UNION, MINUS and INTERSECT commands

The UNION operator combines and returns the result-set retrieved by two or more SELECT statements.

The MINUS operator in SQL is used to remove duplicates from the result-set obtained by the second SELECT query from the result-set obtained by the first SELECT query and then return the filtered results from the first.

The INTERSECT clause in SQL combines the result-set fetched by the two SELECT statements where records from one match the other and then returns this intersection of result-sets.

Certain conditions need to be met before executing either of the above statements in SQL -

• Each SELECT statement within the clause must have the same number of columns

• The columns must also have similar data types

• The columns in each SELECT statement should necessarily have the same order

	```sql
	SELECT name FROM Students   /* Fetch the union of queries */
	UNION
	SELECT name FROM Contacts;
	SELECT name FROM Students   /* Fetch the union of queries with duplicates*/
	UNION ALL
	SELECT name FROM Contacts;
	```
	
	```sql
	SELECT name FROM Students   /* Fetch names from students */
	MINUS     /* that aren't present in contacts */
	SELECT name FROM Contacts;
	```
	
	```sql
	SELECT name FROM Students   /* Fetch names from students */
	INTERSECT    /* that are present in contacts as well */
	SELECT name FROM Contacts;
	```

### What is User defined function What are its various types

The user-defined functions in SQL are like functions in any other programming language that accept parameters, perform complex calculations, and return a value. They are written to use the logic repetitively whenever required. 

There are two types of SQL user-defined functions:

• Scalar Function: As explained earlier, user-defined scalar functions return a single scalar value.

• Table-Valued Functions: User-defined table-valued functions return a table as output.

	• Inline: returns a table data type based on a single SELECT statement.
	
	• Multi-statement: returns a tabular result-set but, unlike inline, multiple SELECT statements can be used inside the function body.

### What is Collation? What are the different types of Collation Sensitivity

Collation refers to a set of rules that determine how data is sorted and compared. Rules defining the correct character sequence are used to sort the character data. It incorporates options for specifying case sensitivity, accent marks, kana character types, and character width. Below are the different types of collation sensitivity:

• Case sensitivity: A and a are treated differently.
• Accent sensitivity: a and á are treated differently.
• Kana sensitivity: Japanese kana characters Hiragana and Katakana are treated differently.
• Width sensitivity: Same character represented in single-byte (half-width) and double-byte (full-width) are treated differently

### What is CLAUSE

Clauses are in-built functions available in SQL and are used for filtering and analysing data quickly allowing the user to efficiently extract the required information from the database.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92531202/167696336-763f115a-4906-46a1-be57-738e270c1308.png)

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What are Aggregate and Scalar functions

An aggregate function performs operations on a collection of values to return a single scalar value. Aggregate functions are often used with the GROUP BY and HAVING clauses of the SELECT statement. Following are the widely used SQL aggregate functions:

• AVG() - Calculates the mean of a collection of values.

• COUNT() - Counts the total number of records in a specific table or view.

• MIN() - Calculates the minimum of a collection of values.

• MAX() - Calculates the maximum of a collection of values.

• SUM() - Calculates the sum of a collection of values.

• FIRST() - Fetches the first element in a collection of values.

• LAST() - Fetches the last element in a collection of values.

Note: All aggregate functions described above ignore NULL values except for the COUNT function.

A scalar function returns a single value based on the input value. Following are the widely used SQL scalar functions:

• LEN() - Calculates the total length of the given field (column).

• UCASE() - Converts a collection of string values to uppercase characters.

• LCASE() - Converts a collection of string values to lowercase characters.

• MID() - Extracts substrings from a collection of string values in a table.

• CONCAT() - Concatenates two or more strings.

• RAND() - Generates a random collection of numbers of a given length.

• ROUND() - Calculates the round-off integer value for a numeric field (or decimal point values).

• NOW() - Returns the current date & time.

• FORMAT() - Sets the format to display a collection of values.
