### What is Database
A database is an organized collection of data, stored and retrieved digitally from a remote or local computer system. Databases can be vast and complex, and such databases are developed using fixed design and modeling approaches

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is DBMS
DBMS stands for Database Management System. DBMS is a system software responsible for the creation, retrieval, updation, and management of the database. It ensures that our data is consistent, organized, and is easily accessible by serving as an interface between the database and its end-users or application software.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is Datawarehouse
Datawarehouse is a central repository of data from multiple sources of information. Those data are consolidated, transformed and made available for the mining and online processing. Warehouse data have a subset of data called Data Marts.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is RDBMS How is it different from DBMS
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. The key difference here, compared to DBMS, is that RDBMS stores data in the form of a collection of tables, and relations can be defined between the common fields of these tables. Most modern database management systems like MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, IBM DB2, and Amazon Redshift are based on RDBMS.

RDBMS: It is referred as Relation Database Management Systems (RDBMS). RDBMS possesses a set of the below given characteristics:

• Write-intensive operations: The RDBMS is frequently written to and is often used in transaction-oriented applications.

• Data in flux or historical data: The RDBMS is designed to handle frequently changing data. Alternatively, RDBMS can also store vast 
amounts of historical data, which can later be analyzed or "mined".

• Application-specific schema: The RDBMS is configured on a per-application basis and a unique schema exists to support each application.

• Complex data models. The relational nature of the RDBMS makes it suitable for handling sophisticated, complex data models that require many tables, foreign key values, complex join operations, and so on.

• Data integrity: The RDBMS features many components designed to ensure data integrity. This includes rollback operations, referential integrity, and transaction-oriented operations.


**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is SQL
SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is the standard language for relational database management systems. It is especially useful in handling organized data comprised of entities (variables) and relations between different entities of the data.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is PL SQL
PL/SQL Control Statements in Oracle.

Control Statements,

•	Control statements are very important in PL/SQL.

•	Control Statements are elements in a program that control the flow of program execution.

•	The syntax of control statements are similar to regular English and are very similar to choices that we make every day.

•	Branching statements are as follows:

o	If statement


o If - THEN - ELSE o Nested IF

o	Branching with logical connectivity

o	While

o	For Loop

### What is the difference between SQL and PL SQL
SQL: It is referred as Structured Query Language.

•	Only simple IF / Else statements.

•	Through SQL you can interact with database through ADO.NET

•	In SQL you can execute a line of code

•	It can run only on windows

PL/SQL: It is referred as Procedure Language / Structure Query Language:

•	In PL/SQL you can execute a block of code not a single line of code.

•	Deep control statements

•	It can run in UNIX also.

•	PL/SQL language includes object oriented programming techniques such as encapsulation, function overloading, and information hiding (all but inheritance).

### What is the difference between SQL and MySQL
SQL is a standard language for retrieving and manipulating structured databases. On the contrary, MySQL is a relational database management system, like SQL Server, Oracle or IBM DB2, that is used to manage SQL databases.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is a database table

Database table: Table contains records in the form of rows and columns. A permanent table is created in the database you specify and remains in the database permanently, until you delete it.

Syntax:

1.	Create table TableName (ID INT, NAME VARCHAR(30) )

2.	Drop syntax: drop table TableName

3.	Select Syntax: Select * from TableName


**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What are tables and Fields
A table is an organized collection of data stored in the form of rows and columns. Columns can be categorized as vertical and rows as horizontal. The columns in a table are called fields while the rows can be referred to as records.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is a query
A Database query is a code written in order to get the information back from the database. Query can be designed in such a way that it matched with our expectation of the result set. Simply, a question to the Database.
   
   ```sql
   SELECT fname, lname    /* select query */
   FROM myDb.students
   WHERE student_id = 1;
   
   
   UPDATE myDB.students    /* action query */
   SET fname = 'Captain', lname = 'America'
   WHERE student_id = 1;
   ```
  
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is subquery
A subquery is a query within another query. The outer query is called as main query, and inner query is called subquery. SubQuery is always executed first, and the result of subquery is passed on to the main query.

(A subquery is a query within another query, also known as a nested query or inner query. It is used to restrict or enhance the data to be queried by the main query, thus restricting or enhancing the output of the main query respectively. For example, here we fetch the contact information for students who have enrolled for the maths subject)

   ```sql
   SELECT name, email, mob, address
  FROM myDb.contacts
  WHERE roll_no IN (
  SELECT roll_no
  FROM myDb.students
  WHERE subject = 'Maths'); 
  ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What are the types of subquery
There are two types of subquery - Correlated and Non-Correlated.
 • A correlated subquery cannot be considered as an independent query, but it can refer to the column in a table listed in the FROM of the main query.
 • A non-correlated subquery can be considered as an independent query and the output of the subquery is substituted in the main query.
    
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is a database relationship
Relationships are created by linking the column in one table with the column in another table. There are four different types of relationship that can be created.

***different types of relationships in SQL

• One-to-One - This can be defined as the relationship between two tables where each record in one table is associated with the maximum of one record in the other table.
• One-to-Many & Many-to-One - This is the most commonly used relationship where a record in a table is associated with multiple records in the other table.
• Many-to-Many - This is used in cases when multiple instances on both sides are needed for defining a relationship.
• Self-Referencing Relationships - This is used when a table needs to define a relationship with itself

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Crud Operations in SQL
CRUD is an abbreviation for Create, Read, Update and Delete. These 4 operations comprise the most basic database operations. The relevant commands for these 4
operations in SQL are:

• Create: INSERT, To insert any new data into a database
• Read: SELECT, We use the select statement to perform the Read ( R ) operation of CRUD.
• Update: UPDATE, used to update the contents of specific columns of specific rows.
• Delete: DELETE,  used to delete or remove some rows from a table.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### How to create a table in SQL
SQL provides an organized way for table creation.

Syntax:  
  ```sql
  Create table TableName (
    columnName1 datatype 
    columnName2 datatype 
   )
  ```
  
  ```sql
  create table Info (
    Name varchar(20)
    BirthDate date
    Phone varchar(12)
    City varchar(20)
  )
  ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### How to update a database table using SQL
To update an existing Table we use SQL Command UPDATE: It will update the records as per user defined query/need.

Syntax:

   ```sql
   Update TableName 
   SET ColumnName = NewData 
   where Condition
   ```
   ```sql
   Update info
   Set City = 'Baroda'
   where id = 2
   ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### How to delete a table in SQL Server
Delete Data Record from Database Table and deleting an existing table by the following method:

Syntax:To delete all table records of a table:
   ```sql
   Delete TableName  // To delete all table records of a table
   
	 Delete TableName  // To delete particular row/column in table
   WHERE condition  
   ```
   
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM info
   WHERE City = "Scaler";
   ``` 
   
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What are the TRUNCATE, DELETE and DROP statements
DELETE statement is used to delete rows from a table.
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM Candidates
   WHERE CandidateId > 1000;
   ```
   
TRUNCATE command is used to delete all the rows from the table and free the space containing the table.
  ```sql
  TRUNCATE TABLE Candidates;
  ```
  
DROP command is used to remove an object from the database. If you drop a table, all the rows in the table are deleted and the table structure is removed from the database.
  ```sql
  DROP TABLE Candidates;
  ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is the difference between DELETE TABLE and TRUNCATE TABLE commands
The TRUNCATE command is used to delete all the rows from the table and free the space containing the table.
The DELETE command deletes only the rows from the table based on the condition given in the where clause or deletes all the rows from the table if no condition is specified. But it does not free the space containing the table.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is the difference between DROP and TRUNCATE statements
If a table is dropped, all things associated with the tables are dropped as well. This includes - the relationships defined on the table with other tables, the integrity checks and constraints, access privileges and other grants that the table has. To create and use the table again in its original form, all these relations, checks, constraints, privileges and relationships need to be redefined. However, if a table is truncated, none of the above problems exist and the table retains its original structure.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### When are we going to use truncate and delete

1.	TRUNCATE is a DDL command, whereas DELETE is a DML command.

2.	We can’t execute a trigger in case of TRUNCATE whilst with DELETE, we can accomplish a trigger.

3.	TRUNCATE is quicker than DELETE, for the reason that when we use DELETE to delete the data, at that time it store the whole 
statistics in the rollback gap on or after where we can get the data back after removal. In case of TRUNCATE, it will not store data in rollback gap and will unswervingly rub it out. TRUNCATE do not recover the deleted data.

4.	We can use any condition in WHERE clause using DELETE but it is not possible with TRUNCATE.5.If a table is referenced by any foreign key constraints, then TRUNCATE won’t work.

### SQL Commands
SQL Commands are instructions that are used by the user to communicate with the database, to perform specific tasks, functions and queries of data
Types of SQL Commands:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92531202/167480510-697ba51c-64a2-4f6b-8633-b46944d70c6a.png)

### Data Definition Language
1. Data Definition Language(DDL): It changes a table’s structure by adding, deleting and altering its contents. Its changes are auto-committed(all changes are automatically permanently saved in the database). Some commands that are a part of DDL are:

CREATE: Used to create a new table in the database.

	```sql
	CREATE TABLE STUDENT(Name VARCHAR2(20), Email VARCHAR2(100), DOB DATE);
	```
	
ALTER: Used to alter contents of a table by adding some new column or attribute, or changing some existing attribute.

	```sql
	ALTER TABLE STUDENT ADD(ADDRESS VARCHAR2(20));
	ALTER TABLE STUDENT MODIFY (ADDRESS VARCHAR2(20));
	```

DROP: Used to delete the structure and record stored in the table
	
	```sql
	DROP TABLE STUDENT;
	```

TRUNCATE: Used to delete all the rows from the table, and free up the space inthe table.

	```sql
	TRUNCATE TABLE STUDENT;
	```
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Data Manipulation Language

2. Data Manipulation Language(DML): It is used for modifying a database, and is responsible for any form of change in a database. These commands are not autocommitted, i.e all changes are not automatically saved in the database. Some
commands that are a part of DML are:
  
  INSERT: Used to insert data in the row of a table
  
	```sql
	INSERT INTO STUDENT (Name, Subject) VALUES ("Scaler", "DSA");
	```
  UPDATE: Used to update value of a table’s column.
 	
	```sql
	UPDATE STUDENT
	SET User_Name = 'Interviewbit'
	WHERE Student_Id = '2'
	```
  DELETE: Used to delete one or more rows in a table.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Data Control Language

3. Data Control Language(DCL): These commands are used to grant and take back access/authority (revoke) from any database user. Some commands that are a part of
DCL are:
    Grant: Used to grant a user access privileges to a database.
    
   ```sql
    GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON TABLE_1 TO USER_1, USER_2;
   ```
   
   Revoke: Used to revoke the permissions from an user.
   
   ```sql
    REVOKE SELECT, UPDATE ON TABLE_1 FROM USER_1, USER_2;
   ```
  https://github.com/Prajwal208V/PreapBytes/blob/master/DataBase/SQL%20cheat%20sheet%20.pdf

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Transaction Control Language
Transaction Control Language: These commands can be used only with DML commands in conjunction and belong to the category of auto-committed
commands. Some commands that are a part of TCL are:
  COMMIT: Saves all the transactions made on a database.
	
	```sql
	DELETE FROM STUDENTS
	WHERE AGE = 16;
	COMMIT;
	```
  ROLLBACK: It is used to undo transactions which are not yet been saved.	
	
	```sql
	DELETE FROM STUDENTS
	WHERE AGE = 16;
	ROLLBACK;
	```
  SAVEPOINT: Used to roll transaction back to a certain point without having to roll back the entirity of the transaction.	
  
       	```sql
	SAVEPOINT SAVED;
	DELETE FROM STUDENTS
	WHERE AGE = 16;
	ROLLBACK TO SAVED;
	```
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

5.Data Query Language: It is used to fetch some data from a database. 

The command belonging to this category is:       
   SELECT: It is used to retrieve selected data based on some conditions which are described using the WHERE clause. It is to be noted that the WHERE clause is
   also optional to be used here and can be used depending on the user’s needs.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What are Constraints in SQL
Constraints are rules which are applied on a table. For example, specifying valid limits or ranges on data in the table etc.
The valid constraints in SQL are:
1. NOT NULL: Specifies that this column cannot store a NULL value

	```sql
	CREATE TABLE Student
	(
	ID int(8) NOT NULL,
	NAME varchar(30) NOT NULL,
	ADDRESS varchar(50)
	);
	```
In the above example, we create a table STUDENT, which has some attributes it has to store. Among these attributes we declare that the columns ID and NAME cannot
have NULL values in their fields using NOT NULL constraint.

2. UNIQUE: Specifies that this column can have only Unique values, i.e the values cannot be repeated in the column.

	```sql
	CREATE TABLE Student
	(
	ID int(8) UNIQUE,
	NAME varchar(10) NOT NULL,
	ADDRESS varchar(20)
	);
	```

In the above example, we create a table Student and declare the ID column to be unique using the UNIQUE constraint.

3. Primary Key: It is a field using which it is possible to uniquely identify each row in a table. We will get to know about this in detail in the upcoming section.
4. Foreign Key: It is a field using which it is possible to uniquely identify each row in some other table. We will get to know about this in detail in the upcoming section.
5. CHECK: It validates if all values in a column satisfy some particular condition or not.
6. 
	```sql
	CREATE TABLE Student
	(
	ID int(6) NOT NULL,
	NAME varchar(10),
	AGE int CHECK (AGE < 20)
	)
	```
Here, in the above query, we add the CHECK constraint into the table. By adding the constraint, we can only insert entries that satisfy the condition AGE < 20 into the
table.

6. DEFAULT: It specifies a default value for a column when no value is specified for that field.

	```sql
	CREATE TABLE Student
	(
	ID int(8) NOT NULL,
	NAME varchar(50) NOT NULL,
	CLASS int DEFAULT 2
	);
	```
	
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is the difference between Primary key and unique key

Primary key does not allow the null values but unique key allows one null value.

Primary key will create clustered index on column but unique key will create non-clustered index by default.
